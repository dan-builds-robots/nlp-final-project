83,Hm
84,Very very interesting
85,Okay
86,Imagine growing up with it
87,<>
88,Okay Well um
89,I'm just gonna kind of bounce around
90,and you talk about
91,some of this some of that
92,Alright
93,Um
94,let's talk about
95,when you first got to Atlanta
96,Um
97,did you notice any difference between
98,here
99,and some other places you lived?
100,<sneeze>
101,How much time you got? ing
102,<>
103,I got plenty
104,Uh
105,yeah
106,it's
107,it's a big
108,it's a big culture shock
109,especially when you
110,when you were born and raised and you grew up a certain way and then you come
111,to somewhere where it's the complete opposite
112,Yeah it's definitely a culture shock
113,but
114,mostly positive
115,Okay
116,you know what I'm saying
117,So
118,it's definitely the place like I said the
119,the land of opportunity for our people anyway
120,for colored people should I say not necessarily Black
121,but just
122,people who ain't white
123,Mmhm
124,Puerto Ricans Mexicans Black people
125,you know Muslims
126,all of that
127,Dig that I dig that
128,What about um
129,what what is your thoughts on racism
130,or just race
131,related type of
132,No you said it right the first time Racism is a
133,issues
134,it exists
135,It's very real
136,and
137,I'm Black so
138,I'm naturally
139,the target of it I'm a Black young female
140,so
141,I had three strikes against me coming out the womb
142,Mmhm
143,but it's strikes that I'll
144,that I wear with pride
145,So
146,it's a it exists
147,It's real It's very real here
148,Um
149,sadly
150,the shocking part for me though even though it is very real in the South
151,I've experienced
152,less
153,racism here than I have growing up where I grew up
154,you feel what I'm saying
155,Mm
156,Like
157,growing up where I grew up
158,different ethnicities
159,were racist against each other There were Chinese people that did not like Black people
160,There are Puerto Rican people who
161,do not like Mexicans
162,So
163,coming here where it's like
164,no
165,white people don't like colored people It has nothing to
166,it it has everything to do with being Black but
167,it's not just being Black It's colored people
168,people who are not white are not welcome
169,Wow
170,Okay
171,And that's real
172,and
173,I think once people ch
174,get over the fact that
175,get over the whole idea of tryna bring us all together and become one and
176,make us all equal or make us equal in their eyes Once we get over that fact then we'll be able to conquer this whole thing and get past it But until then
177,as long as we're tryna become equal to them
178,we will
179,always
180,be in a struggle with them
181,Mm
182,Very profound
183,Okay
184,Let's jump towards family information
185,Do you have any siblings?
186,Yes I do
187,Okay
188,I have
189,two little sisters and now
190,two little brothers

201,Yes
202,M my
203,younger sister 
204,That she is my favorite
205,Why is she your favorite out of everybody?
206,Because
207,I've been so involved with her life
208,since the day she was born that
209,she was my kid before my kids was my kids
210,Shut up Sparky
211,Sorry about that
212,<>
213,<>
214,<>

221,y
222,that's m that's my
223,that's my heart
224,Oh
225,But I love all of them
226,just as much but
227,that's my baby
228,Okay cool cool cool What about um
229,are you close to any aunts uncles grandparents cousins
230,Um
231,extended family?
232,I do have
233,a few aunts When I say a few
234,literally
235,maybe two
236,Mm
237,that I am very very close with
238,Um
239,cousins
240,very close with them
241,most
242,some of them
243,not all of them but some of them
244,Basically pretty much the ones that I grew up with
245,for the most part I'm close with
246,Um like I said my aunts and uncles
247,my uncles
248,<ts>
249,I grew up with them so they raised me
250,But after I got a certain age it was
251,it kind of got shaky
252,which is natural but
253,for the most part I love all my family I love anybody who loves me
254,G
255,G ish
256,Okay
257,School days
258,Hoo
259,Where did you go to school?
260,Which one?
261,I went to f
262,Let's start with middle school
263,one
264,two
265,I went to two different middle schools
266,Which in uh
267,which were also culture shocks <>
268,w in Georgia?
269,In uh
270,I went to
271,couple schools here but
272,I grew up
273,like I said in Jersey so I went to school in Jersey
274,Um
275,School in Jersey
276,I went to a middle school I went to two different middle schools
277,I went to a charter school and then I went to a public middle school
278,Okay well
279,just in a capsule between those two
280,how different was the charter school from the public school in Jersey?
281,<exhale>
282,Needless to say I got kicked out of the charter school
283,Okay
284,and I had to go to the public school But it was
285,it was very different and
286,it was being ran by a white guy
287,and
288,that's where the difference came in
289,Mmhm
290,It was
291,it's hard to teach
292,it's hard to teach something to someone when y
293,you don't know anything about them
294,You can't teach me You don't know me
295,Mmhm
296,How can you teach me?
297,You can't teach me what you know because we don't know We don't come from the same place
298,You're a Jewish white man
299,Mmhm
300,I'm a young Black little girl
301,Mmhm
302,We don't have the same
303,situation happening here
304,so it's hard for me to feel like I can look to you for guidance or edu
305,or
306,education or anything else like that when
307,y I know for a fact you don't understand me You don't know what it's like for me when I walk out of these doors
308,just like I don't know what it's like for you when you walk out of these doors
309,So
310,that that was a
311,that
312,played a big part in one of the reasons why I got kicked out
313,So
314,Mmhm
315,once I got kicked out and I went to a
316,predominantly
317,colored school
318,Mmhm
319,it was different
320,Felt like
321,the fact that they could relate more
322,They understood
323,that could teach
324,And it was funny because my teacher was a white man
325,but
326,he
327,spent
328,all his life around
329,African American people His wife was African American
330,Mmhm
331,So
332,his m
333,father
334,was African American so it wasn't like he was too far off base
335,Hold on who are we talking about again?
336,My teacher
337,The white teacher
338,The white teacher
339,So how can
340,he have
341,a Black father if he's a white teacher?
342,Like are we talking about biological?
343,Yeah
344,His biological father was white
345,but his mother
346,I mean his biological father was Black
347,but his mother was white
348,But he had i
349,But he looked
350,he looked
351,extra white
352,white
353,He didn't look extra white but he looked white When you looked at him
354,you th automatically thought white You did not think oh he's Black
355,Now once you got close up on him you probably be like
356,oh okay he got curly hair
357,??
358,His nose not like white people
359,Yeah
360,He ain't got green or blue eyes His eyes is brown
361,you know what I'm saying He had a little soul in his voice
362,Yeah you could tell he grew up around Black people or somebody in his family somewhere is Black But
363,when you look at him he looks like a white man
364,Oh wow Okay
365,You ever heard of a rapper named Logic?
366,Yes and I love him
367,I rock I r
368,I just watched his performance on the VMAs
369,I heard it was good
370,I didn't really check for him yet but he definitely give me that
371,ah damn I could've sworn bruh was white
372,but he's really Black
373,but I
374,No he's not
375,He's not white He's Black and Jewish
376,Black and Jewish
377,Very very interesting I know we can
378,dive more
379,deeply into that very very soon
380,So
381,how um
382,far was the schools from your crib?
383,Um the charter school
384,was
385,I wanna say about
386,thirty
387,thirtyfive minutes
388,a drive
389,But the public school
390,was
391,a walk literally It was around literally around the corner Like I could walk up one block and hit a corner and hit another corner and I was at school
392,Okay did you usually walk? Or
393,Yeah
394,I walked
395,Okay
396,every day
397,Did you have a
398,little crew with you when you walked?
399,Absolutely No I d I didn't need a crew when I walked What I did I have a crew at school? Yeah but
400,I didn't need a crew
401,Just for walking you didn't need that You was good
402,No
403,I was cool
404,good money
405,Okay
406,Um
407,<ts>
408,let's see
409,since you said something about your crew
410,um
411,what did y'all do together?
412,Get into a whole lot of trouble
413,Oh yeah?
414,Yeah
415,I was a horrible child
416,I tell my mother every day God bless her and I love her for putting up with me cause I was
417,the worst
418,You seem like you know your definitions of word Why would you use the word
419,horrible?
420,Cause I was that kid that
421,you know how you had that kid growing up in school that your parents be like stay away from them
422,I was that kid

618,My mom my stepdad my little brothers
619,they're here
620,Hm
621,What um
622,let's see I'm'a I'm'a get it so we can talk more about some Atlanta stuff
623,So y
624,um the first neighborhood
625,or just area you came to when you was here?
626,RDADDRESS
627,RDADDRESS
628,RDADDRESS
629,off of RDADDRESS Road
630,RDADDRESS Road
631,Over there on a
632,in Ellenwood Georgia
633,RDADDRESS well no Ellenwood Georgia okay
634,Mmhm
635,What's it what was the um
636,dynamic out there?
637,Depressing
638,Why?
639,Cause when you come from somewhere that's so active
640,and you come to somewhere that's so secluded
641,it's a shock
642,especially as a young child
643,or not even as a young child as a
644,Yeah
645,teenager
646,Uhhuh
647,who's
648,used to living their life a certain way used to seeing
649,certain things and hearing certain things And then you come to somewhere where
650,across the street instead of it being a grocery store I mean instead of being a corner store or
651,Mm
652,a laundromat or whatever it's
653,nothing
654,but trees
655,The convenience
656,was stripped away and it was
657,Automatically
658,it wasn't as many people around or at least people you would wanna hang around
659,It was the neighborhood
660,It was the culdesac
661,Yeah
662,and our that's that's all it was
663,And that was like I said
664,a culture shock
665,O
666,I'll never forget when we pulled up at the
667,on our way
668,I didn't know When we were
669,pulling into the neighborhood I did not know that we were pulling into the neighborhood I thought that we were still on the main road to get to wherever we were going
670,<>
671,So when we stopped the truck I thought we were at a truck stop somewhere
672,Oh no this can't be good
673,to you know rest or whatever And then I get out the car and the next thing I know I see my mom and my dad and everybody's getting out the truck And I'm like why are we all stopping here? And they were like this is it And I'm like what's it?
674,Yeah
675,Ah
676,It's like nah this is where we living Who's living here?
677,<>
678,Where's the stores?
679,Ah god
680,Where's the buses? Where's the cabs? Where's the trains? Where's the noise? Where is the s
681,Where's the noise
682,Where's the sidewalks? Where's the sidewalks? There's no sidewalks here
683,Okay
684,Wow
685,So it was like I said it was definitely
686,an adjustment
687,for sure
688,Mm
689,Did it seem safer
690,in that environment
691,than
692,opposed to the one before?
693,Yes
694,Okay
695,<ts> Absolutely
696,Safer in the sense of
697,when you're up north whatever's going on you see it
698,If there's drugs
699,being sold you see it
700,Police riding by in helicopters
701,fire
702,fire department
703,crack heads outside screaming arguing with each other drunks on the corner
704,yelling smashing bottles
705,all that
706,You see it You hear it It's directly in front of your face cannot be avoided
707,Mmhm
708,Down here
709,Mm
710,you don't see that
711,There is no
712,crack heads on the corner
713,There is no
714,winos walking up and down the block There is no
715,there isn't that
716,Mmhm
717,Now in that aspect yes It did seem safer but
718,like I said that's the
719,beauty in the beast
720,of
721,being here
722,because just cause you don't see it that don't mean it ain't happening
723,Yeah
724,You just don't see it
725,Yo like somebody can
726,pull your ass off in them woods and

740,I believe
741,between three to six months of me first moving here somebody
742,found a girl in the woods
743,two
744,maybe like two minutes from where I was living
745,<inhale>
746,So I was just like oh okay So they get it popping down here They just don't get it
747,popping in front of your face but it's goi it's going down
748,Mmhm
749,And then once I got to get out and explore the neighborhood that I was in more I realized like oh

932,of
933,everything he said
934,and I could never understand what he said
935,<>
936,It was like as if he just blended all the words into one long ass word

271,maybe like
272,middle school
273,Mm
274,Mm
275,inaudible
276,growing up in middle school
277,it was
278,tough cause I was a weirdo man

280,<>
281,Everybo everybody that is okay
282,Okay I
283,That's okay
284,I think it's very okay to be a weirdo
285,I honestly I feel like in this generation

287,it's way cooler to be a weirdo now Not so much back then though
288,they
289,Nah not not not not at all back then
290,?
291,Damn not at all
292,Like I was suffering back then
293,My middle school like bruh
294,my shit was so dry bruh
295,They say the meek shall inherit the earth so you just never peaked yet man
296,And I I'm a late bloomer
297,You a late bloomer I am too man
298,I'm a late bloomer It is what it is you know what I'm saying
299,S
300,it's something to be proud of
301,Like
302,I developed myself
303,to where I started to find out
304,uh more about myself in middle school because of poetry
305,Okay
306,In middle school
307,in growing up in school
308,that was my biggest background was poetry
309,because
310,sixth grade
311,the curriculum came
312,shout out to Miss 
313,Mmhm
314,you know what I'm saying she the one taught me that shit
315,So
316,from that point
317,you know she encouraged me to keep going
318,and from there I was like okay
319,So I I
320,I loved
321,I loved the fact that
322,it was
323,everything that
324,I needed at that point
325,Poetry provided
326,the
327,organization and
328,Mm
329,and and and substance and
330,the therapy that I needed at that time because
331,you know it was just like
332,you know it was six grade like I said I'm being the only child
333,my parents
334,like my mom I was living with my mom and her boyfriend
335,so it was just like
336,you know they weren't
337,too like
338,involved
339,with my personal life
340,Okay
341,Yeah like so it was just like we all lived in that house but
342,it's like we didn't really actually communicate with each other
343,H
344,So
345,yeah so
346,you know
347,school was really
348,the only thing that provided me some type of hope towards
349,a better future and this that and the other which is
350,you know crazy cause I still don't
351,I don't fuck with school
352,You really enjoyed going to school like that though
353,<>
354,Only because it provided things that weren't provided at my home
355,Oh man whispered
356,You see what I'm saying
357,Like I said poetry like came along and
358,you know once I found out how to start writing bruh like
359,When were y when were you when were you poetry guy like when were you the best at the poetry?
360,from
361,Um
362,Or were you
363,even the best at the poetry
364,<exhale> man I I don't
365,back then?
366,know every
367,person who made poetry
368,Mmhm
369,cause you know
370,poets aren't like artists like rappers
371,They don't s
372,They don't just be like
373,??
374,I write poetry you know what I'm saying and be spitting poetry bars
375,Like motherfuckers write that shit in they class
376,Okay
377,it's like in the back
378,N
379,t s
380,you know what I'm saying just ch y in a cut
381,right
382,on some cool ass shit
383,on some cool shit you know what I'm saying Like
384,Mmhm
385,and
386,at that time like ninth grade like ninth grade's when I started
387,fullfledge
388,everything The poetry the rap
389,Okay
390,you know what I'm saying It fused together to where
391,Mmhm
392,you know what I'm saying from ninth grade on I propelled
393,from there
394,you know what I'm saying but
395,middle school I had the foundation
396,of poetry
397,Nah that's perfect cause
398,that's like evidence you was doing it before it was trendy
399,before it was cool and shit like that Nah definitely
400,<>
401,Right right
402,Those people I think are the rawest I'm
403,I
404,I was definitely doing this beat shit before there was YouTube
405,tutorial videos inaudible so
406,Yeah like breathy
407,it came natural you know what I'm saying like this
408,it wasn't
409,Struggle
410,forced
411,Like it was a gift that was already given to me and
412,through me learning poetry of course I'm gonna learn poetry in rhythm
413,rhythm in poetry
414,You gotta really be somebody to take it there cause some people scared to take it there with the poetry shit
415,Mmhm
416,Yeah bruh I mean
417,that's
418,where it all started
419,So what what
420,what is it w about poetry that some rhyme and some doesn't?
421,Some rhyme and some doesn't?
422,Cause you just say what
423,What's your preference?
424,whatever comes I mean
425,there is no preference
426,because with poetry it's so
427,it's infinite
428,you know what I'm saying infinite possibilities on what type of poem you can make
429,So it's just like
430,you know the poetry
431,that rhymes
432,you know some some poetry is just literally you s you talking
433,through
434,you know stream of consciousness
435,So you just saying things you saying you saying whatever
436,it it may be you may use poetic terms
437,you know things like that to make it sound like a actual poem but like
438,Mmhm
439,Okay
440,it may not even rhyme
441,You know but then
442,Yeah like I'm tryna
443,like anything can be a poem if that's the case though right?
444,If it don't have to rhyme and
445,Well you gotta think about
446,don't have to
447,let's say
448,for instance a speech
449,a speech has
450,logos pathos and ethos
451,Okay
452,I don't know what that is
453,but I heard that before
454,Alright
455,So these are different terminologies in speech
456,that people learn but it's also used in poetry as well
457,It's
458,you know the logical emotional
459,and the shit I forgot the other one
460,<>
461,but you know around that that concept
462,So it's just like they use
463,like
464,you know I'm'a have to read something
465,Okay
466,I got I gotta read you something
467,I dismiss myself from nigga the king
468,so dismiss me as a nigga when I call you queen
469,Apple isn't far from the tree which means
470,I'm a world away from niggas falling towards me
471,Out in the sun we catch vitamin D
472,Offer you the finer things
473,Could you catch the experience if I offered it for free?
474,Liberation at its best
475,couldn't catch a thing
476,It was separating materials and physicalities
477,just to see if your mentality on knowledge of diamonds
478,that determines if it's Zeus or Poseidon
479,I show you ocean
480,Do you wanna fly like lightning or is your mind set to coasting?
481,All retrospective just to see who you are
482,I just gotta aks the questions to explore your spectrum
483,So from now on what we talk about ain't out the rectum
484,Rectifying
485,electrifying
486,conversation just to prove you're mine
487,You know what I'm saying
488,boom boom
489,<>
490,That was dope
491,That was dope to the max
492,Gonna be rich
493,<>
494,<>
495,That was really cool
496,So how old are you?
497,I am twentythree years old
498,Twentythree
499,That's a good number
500,<>
501,I think

505,five years from now?
506,Well
507,five years?
508,Well

514,my plans in my head of how things are supposed to go or what I would like
515,Mm
516,Mmhm
517,you know
518,but
519,I'm at this point in time
520,I'm just kind of letting things evolve as
521,as
522,I'm going
523,because my biggest
524,focus now is to keep
525,moving
526,to keep

534,a
535,going towards legacy
536,classic
537,things of that nature
538,longevity
539,Okay
540,You know why would I why would I aim for

1423,Under the bludgeonings of chance
1424,my head is bloody
1425,but unbowed
1426,Beyond this place of wrath and tears looms but the horror of the shade
1427,and yet
1428,the menace of the years
1429,finds and shall find me
1430,unafraid
1431,It matters not how strait
1432,the gate

440,you know
441,<ts>
442,yu you wo w
443,w
444,whate e everything is dictated up off something else
445,You bring the ball up The defense tries to cut this off so you react a certain way and
446,it it causes so many chain reactions and so many different possibilities
447,That's true
448,I love basketball
449,Football is a lot more
450,Strategic
451,strategic premeditated y alright here it goes
452,Yeah
453,and just this is how it planned out
454,Mmhm
455,type stuff
456,Exact basketball is just spur of the moment
457,It's a lot more variables
458,right here
459,And it's so much contact Basketball is the most physical sport We don't have no pads no helmet no nothing
460,We out here just hitting each other
461,Every time
462,every time
463,and it's so physical
464,and just the struggle
465,you know to get where you wanna get which is the hole
466,and
467,you know seeing the ball go through alright
468,I I have a
469,g I'm I'm g
470,you know it's it's there're no more satisfying feeling you know what I mean
471,Kobe Bryant
472,was on a NBA court for twenty years
473,Mmhm
474,And that must have taken the biggest toll on his body
475,??
476,just
477,running like the bottom of your soles under your foot should just be bleeding just out like how
478,Yes
479,is that a normal thing for a human being to be able to do?
480,He was on the NBA court for twenty years
481,not to mention
482,Jumping ??
483,coming up
484,<>
485,from
486,you know
487,playing in
488,Basket
489,elementary
490,to middle school to high school all that
491,ball
492,Oh you gotta put those miles into consideration
493,That's so ma
494,Those miles don't go nowhere
495,and for him to go twenty years in the NBA and to dominate the way he did
496,<ts>
497,That's why Kobe's my favorite player
498,Kobe's definitely
499,my favorite player over Jordan
500,at the end of the day
501,I'm telling y I feel like
502,I don't know I just
503,I fuck with both of them you see Jordan there
504,yeah I fool I f I yeah Jordan is Jordan is the dope
505,Kobe there
506,I recognize him as the best
507,but Kobe
508,is just that nigga ? man <>
509,He was like he was just that guy like
510,He's that mother fucking guy
511,Re Kobe played in the NBA finals with the
512,For Bryant to really show me something for me to even it's just like ??
513,I don't I don't necessarily
514,not yet not for real
515,no I don't I don't I don't think LeBron
516,can ever measure up with Kobe for the simple fact that
517,Kobe's Kobe
518,he let his injuries
519,and his situations define him
520,in whatever when he when he when he lost in the finals
521,he had oh
522,my mom was messing with my teammate and that through me off
523,And he the other final oh I had a
524,caught a cramp and now I can't play Other final oh I'm I got hit in the head and now this and
525,? whose fault is that cause what if that really did fuck with LeBron to where he couldn't play?
526,I mean yeah but
527,Kobe was battling a rape charge
528,Kobe had a disloca he three dislocated fingers
529,a ruptured knee
530,They always talk about that That's the worst possible thing
531,a dislocated shoulder and a uh what was it it's like his arm was like hyperextended
532,unintelligible He just what? He just didn't wanna seem like a
533,bitch? Why the fuck ??
534,Nah he just did i
535,he just wanted to win
536,His the will to win was so
537,like look it okay the two people that they talk about
538,Hey unintelligible
539,Kobe and Jordan
540,Jordan had the f
541,it cause like LeBron Oh it was too hot in the arena
542,and
543,I caught cramps
544,Jordan had the flu When you have the flu you don't have no
545,hundred and one temperature like when you got the fever Yo you up there
546,You you you you could die
547,You could die
548,He played in an NBA finals game and had
549,what forty some points?
550,Why? ing
551,But LeBron is the greatest No man Fu I can't no it's no too many excuses
552,But is LeBron
553,talentedly better than Michael Jordan though?
554,Is he more basket
555,well now I don't know I don't wanna say basketball fit
556,I would say LeBron is more athletic than Jordan
557,I will give him that He's more athletic
558,More athletic
559,His b
560,his body is more
561,fit f
562,for him to do what he wants to do on the court He's physically imposing
563,He's bigger than him He stronger than Jordan
564,Yeah he's bigger he's stronger
565,He's faster
566,Yeah yeah he's fa for his size if he is exceptionally faster than Jordan
567,Mm
568,For his size
569,But
570,Jordan's willpower his knowledge of the game and just his sure strength and
571,all out desire to win push a
572,Jordan would whoop LeBron ass
573,every time
574,Every time
575,You think so?
576,Every time
577,He's his will to win
578,I feel like
579,if LeBron and Jordan
580,You don't think that woulda made LeBron a better basketball player and just still smash on Jordan?
581,If if if LeBron was to play Jordan it would make him a better basketball player because he would learn from Jordan but I mean like if if LeBron
582,Yeah
583,He wouldn't inaudible
584,if it's just one on one straight up
585,I feel like Jordan's determination and his will to win
586,is gonna push him past LeBron
587,every single time
588,Cause
589,after a while when Jordan keep hitting them shots LeBron gonna find some excuse
590,or he gonna be like man you know what this is Jordan Fuck it
591,Yeah
592,You know what I mean
593,It's always gonna be that factor like
594,Jordan is going to win he's going a and that's another reason why I exp
595,I respect Kobe so much cause he the same way
596,When he was
597,nineteen in the NBA he going to Jordan like
598,nigga either you gonna win or I'm gonna win but I guarantee you you gonna fight for this
599,I ain't giving up
600,Yo
601,You know what I mean ing
602,Nah ?
603,LeBron went
604,LeBron went against Kobe and after a while LeBron started fading away started guarding other players and Kobe just kept killing
605,Mm
606,I got that game on tape
607,<>
608,He said he's got the game on tape
609,But LeBron be passing though
610,Yeah that's that's another thing his killer instinct he doesn't
611,he d
612,i Kob I'm rememb uh
613,Oh you you think it's a problem for LeBron to be
614,like cause I always thought Michael Jordan was cool but I didn't think he passed the ball enough
615,I think
616,I think yeah a you should pass the ball you get your teammates involved but
617,at a certain point
618,it's
619,okay It's
620,it's my time
621,because you're the leader of the team
622,everybody's supposed to look at you
623,not
624,Mm
625,look for you to create for me so I can hit the game winner
626,Oh okay
627,Like it's l it's ay bro it's fourth quarter two minutes this is your time You supposed to be
628,wasn't this that and then you and you can see it
629,Mm
630,you can see it during the game
631,Mm
632,Like it's crunch time
633,They're down or they're up
634,by like a small margin
635,and he makes a move passes it off and they looking like I don't know what to do Like why you passing it to me? Like you must want it back
636,But it's a
637,but I mean it's like a good open shot usually if you pass it off It not like the dumb
638,<>
639,Yeah
640,play
641,it is but I mean
642,certain players are built for certain things
643,cause maybe
644,like
645,me
646,maybe he know his game
647,<>
648,Okay mayb
649,so what Jordan can shoot better?
650,I guess
651,Oh Jordan has absolute
652,midrange
653,down
654,absolute all around
655,three point
656,midrange
657,? yeah
658,turn around He got the better jump shot period
659,He got the better jump shot period
660,But
661,LeBron
662,And he's just a better closer He just knows how to close but
663,That closing thing
664,nudges him over everything else the fact that
665,Mmhm
666,That closer He's that he go
667,LeBron triple double
668,it didn't matter
669,uh what was that g
670,the uh if pe people don't even realize this
671,the NBA finals
672,nineteen ninety eight when Jordan hit that move and crossed
673,uh Bryon Russell at the free throw line
674,Jordan had like forty some points
675,but
676,I think like
677,like seventeen of his points or something like that they came from the free throw line He didn't hit those jumpers
678,He was missing
679,a lot of shots
680,He missed
681,Oh you're saying like he
682,he missed an unbelievable number of shots
683,I think I remember that too cause I think they was gonna lose that bitch
684,Yeah
685,He missed so many shots
686,but when they needed it
687,He steals
688,he came down lay up
689,steal
690,bucket
691,He I I don't care what's going on
692,he ready to go
693,Left Cleveland
694,Yeah
695,then they lost in the finals in Miami He left Miami
696,Yeah
697,went to Cleveland won a ring Now they lost in Cleveland and now he's
698,they
699,so will LeBron stay? He's talking about lea
700,why every time you lose you ca you
701,can you come back and just win again? What are you doing?
702,Because what
703,<>
704,are you comparing them his um
705,career to Jordan?
706,Bo
707,Cause Jordan stayed in the Bulls?
708,M not not even just Jordan like
709,majority of the great players that
710,we talk about today
711,one team
712,Like who?
713,Hakeem Olajuwon Rockets
714,All Rockets Magic Johnson all Lakers
715,I f I ride with them
716,Jordan
717,all Bulls Kobe
718,all Lakers Kareem AbdulJabbar all Lakers Larry Bird all Boston
719,They didn't
720,they stuck it out
721,Kareem Kareem came from Milwaukee though
722,When they
723,I mean he came from Milwaukee but like
724,He had a championship with them too
725,he was
726,i he he wasn't like
727,a jump shipper
728,Like they he was traded They he
729,you don't have control over that
730,It's like
731,So what's the difference?
732,LeBron signed free agency meaning okay this is I'm going to go here
733,You ca I'm gonna go here
734,So it's okay for the owners to not make it fair
735,but it's
736,you know it's I mean it's fair for the owners them not make it fair but it's not fair for the players that make it
737,I fee I feel that way I feel like okay cause
738,if if it's
739,okay like okay
740,for instance
741,you
742,you want say say uh okay you wa you you wanna go to
743,you wanna go to a s a s a s
744,okay let's say a
745,you wanna go to some event
746,You wanna go to
747,Mmhm
748,birthday bash in Atlanta You wanna go to birthday bash
749,Mmhm
750,You get everything ready for birthday bash
751,You got your bottles You got your outfit ready You whipping all this
752,Okay
753,You get to the door
754,You paid your you paid for your ticket
755,Mmhm
756,But
757,whoever's hosting it say oh no we moved it
758,It's not here anymore
759,Damn
760,You did everything you were supposed to do
761,Mmhm
762,It's on the other end
763,where where the fallacies come
764,come come in
765,Yeah
766,That's that has nothing to do with you
767,That's not your fault
768,Mm
769,But if you just decide
770,you gonna hype everybody u ay y'all we going to birthday bash We finna do this We finna do this Everybody get ready Everybody's on your ship
771,Oh
772,And everybody ready to go with you and you be like nah I'm not going there no more I'm going this way

775,It's like ma It's like matter fact I'm just going to summer jam up in the
776,Yeah we just gonna go to summer jam up in New up in New York
777,Oh
778,That's the way I feel like like y
779,if it was if it wasn't his fault like if if he was traded or something like that
780,Because he wa he was the man
781,He
782,man
783,in every city he was in he was the man He came out of high school the chosen one
784,Went to the finals got swept
785,I was talking about KD just then
786,Oh KD I I d I I I have lost a lot of respect for Kevin Durant
787,A lot of people say that I I gained a lot of res
788,even more respect for him I'm I'm'a
789,I'm'a thug it out with KD
790,I lost a lot of respect for KD
791,because
792,it was like
793,everybody wanted KD to win a ring
794,They had
795,Yeah
796,every
797,they they had the tools in Oklahoma City
798,They had enough
799,They coulda beat OKC
800,to win it
801,to win a ring They could've beat the Warriors
802,They coulda beat OKC this year definitely w if
803,but I don't think Durant woulda played as good as he did or
804,Westbrook woulda played as good as he did
805,with them together And that's amazing
806,n
807,That really is
808,Yeah
809,freaking amazing
810,I can understand that
811,Russell Westbrook is the MVP
812,but
813,like it or not
814,yeah he's that Russ Russell West and that and then and that's speaks to Russell Westbrook cause everybody said Russell Westbrook was holding back Kevin Durant
815,But now that Kevin Durant's gone and we see what Russell Westbrook's doing
816,Kevin Durant is the best player in the world right now though
817,in
818,including
819,Russell Westbrook being the MVP
820,He's still acting like that and performing like that
821,I don't know
822,technically
823,I b I
824,On the best team
825,which sucks
826,for everybody else but
827,that's what it's gonna go down in history as
828,True
829,I just b that's that's what it's gonna go down in history as
830,but I mean as far as Kevin Durant's legacy when they tell his story
831,Mm
832,Mmhm
833,they gonna come to that portion
834,after the MVP after
835,you know the next season they gonna be like w
836,well
837,well you
838,you were on the Thunder and you lost to the Warriors What did you do? I went and joined the Warriors
839,So you went and played for the people that beat you?
840,Yeah
841,Yeah
842,You didn't wanna beat them? You didn't wanna
843,get ba
844,oh no I wen I figured if
845,they gonna beat me I'm'a go
846,get on they
847,that's like
848,That's the weirdest shit ever I ain't gonna lie
849,that's like i that's like i when you playing pick up ball
850,and
851,you go toe to toe with a team
852,Oh then s oh and they
853,and w we lose and they like ay man
854,we still winning though
855,Yeah come come play with us
856,Come
857,come come play
858,Yeah and you ??
859,And you like yeah sure I'll p nah

862,You was just talking
863,Nah
864,you was just talking so much good game to me
865,how sorry I was and how trash I was
866,But
867,but think about it but
868,but now you want me to play with you?
869,but think about it like this
870,What if you had to sit down with those people
871,and it was
872,thirty other teams in that bitch
873,and you know
874,that they was gonna have to play before you got a chance to play again
875,That could be
876,I that that could be a factor but
877,with Kevin Durant's talent
878,sh
879,That nigga mighta not ever had another chance to ever
880,get back to
881,wherever bruh
882,I don't know
883,but I feel like
884,you see how they talk about Charles Barkley?
885,Okay but look look okay

375,well look 
376,Don't switch up
377,Have you um
378,encountered any um
379,I guess people within the
380,the music business that you felt like you had that type of
381,relationship with
382,and then um I guess
383,you um
384,came to the realization that that might not
385,actually be the case
386,stuff
387,from ??
388,Could you repeat that question one more time? I'm'a make sure I understand you
389,I'm'a try to I'm'a try to make it as clear as possible Like is there anyone
390,clearly
391,in the music industry businesswise
392,you've worked with
393,that um
394,you felt like
395,you've compensated them or you're
396,you know
397,you're willing to compensate them now
398,to um be compensated later on in the future and
399,I guess
400,maybe the opportunity came around and that
401,didn't um
402,come across as such or whatever?
403,I don't know
404,Man I'm really so lost in the question You said
405,but I compensate somebody now
406,Have you helped somebody out
407,they get in a situation they can help you out and they don't help you out?
408,Oh yeah it's happened plenty of times
409,Okay

413,I I
414,keeps your faith in what? Just the fact that you like helping people out that's the only thing
415,I mean you know
416,in s in some sense it's to answer the first question first
417,Mmhm
418,I don't really do it for them to help me out
419,Okay
420,I do it because you know it's it's out the kindness of my heart
421,But I do
422,think about the fact that when they get somewhere
423,you know you invest in friendships and and and relationships for example
424,you know what I'm saying I'm looking out for you cause I know
425,I can help you get to somewhere you need to go So

59,I ain't the dumbest
60,Mmhm

174,Mmhm
175,So I
176,my focus was not really tryna put so much attention on
177,to dropping something this year It was really just focusing on it and getting it where I could drop it the right way
178,with the right marketing behind it man I I'm'a I'm'a always be relevant long as I walk around with that sign
179,Ooh I'm always gonna be relevant ing
180,Like
181,You talking some shit right now but
182,I mean I that's just real
183,it's factual
184,It's all the way real especially
185,Man everywhere I go man it's like
186,everybody like I could try to talk to people and give them compliments
187,Mm
188,and then somehow it always revert back to man you your grinding the sign you inspire me So
189,I li I like the fact that people tell me I inspire them man
190,Mm
191,Mmhm
192,I mean it's just I'm just speaking facts man A lot of artists be telling me bruh you the only artist
193,that I really feel like is
194,the competition when I be really feeling like
195,Mm
196,you ain't my competition Not no disrespect to no artists or nothing but it just
197,Nah I feel you
198,the competition is so much bigger than
199,ATL so much bigger than the South We competing against
200,people across the world So
201,We are
202,you know I dig them for them to say that I'm their competition
203,Mmhm
204,or that I'm somebody they
205,feel like they
206,you know
207,Mmhm
208,inspire? inaudible
209,one and two or two and one however that may be the one two punch you know what I'm saying But I get that from a lot of artists but
210,Mmhm
211,Yeah
212,yeah you ain't not finna get that from me because they not my competition man i
213,You looking at people like Drake and Kendrick
214,Nah I I'm looking at the person like in the mirror
215,Ooh okay
216,Bigger than
217,that now
218,Man Drake I mean
219,e Drake ain't no bigger than
220,me or Drake ain't no bigger than nobody else He just had his opportunity before we did
221,That's a great great way to look at it
222,You know what I'm saying he just had his opportunity come and that's it you know what I'm saying I'm'a have my opportunity when it come
223,I'm'a be
224,probably go longer than Drake as far as number one hits
225,Mmhm
226,cause I got 'em
227,And then I still ain't even reached
228,I still ain't even learnt myself fully I haven't been able to be in the studio
229,twentyfour hours back to back to back
230,It hasn't happened yet
231,you know what I'm saying I I can only go to the studio when I can afford to go
232,Oh my gosh
233,Mmhm
234,you know what I'm saying And that's cool I can knock out five six songs in about a four five hour session
235,But
236,to learn yourself to just be in there and just learn yourself man that's a whole different
237,Woo hoo hoo
238,whole different feeling man you know what I'm saying
239,Yeah that is a a nice little
240,I don't think nobody touching me right now I don't think nobody gonna be touching me then You know I'm already a dangerous guy
241,Mmhm
242,So when I really get
243,that
244,a team that work just as hard as me all across the board
245,it's gonna be even more dangerous
246,Hoo okay So let's say
247,your words
248,as of right now
249,was good enough to
250,I guess get your
251,your marketing pushed like how you would want it to and
252,your single drop
253,in
254,cover to wherever
255,Just off your words alone what would you feel
256,need to be I guess
257,mandatory
258,in your
259,dro n
260,when you drop the sign
261,or whatever?
262,Um breathy
263,What's just some
264,couple of media
265,I mean uh marketing tactics that you would like to see on your behalf?
266,I mean first of all I just wanna see the people support it All the people who say talk to me out in the streets I just wanna see them support That's the biggest market word of mouth
267,Okay
268,through the people you know what I'm saying
269,I'm not gonna really release all my m
270,my strategies that we got planned up
271,Okay
272,cause we still cooking 'em up
273,Mmhm
274,But you know just to have people
275,themselves talking about what I got going on telling somebody else about it ? That's the best marketing because
276,I only know about music when my friends tell me about it
277,Mmhm
278,And it's like okay I gotta listen to it now cause you told me about it I know you don't listen to that BS music So
279,word of mouth just people rocking with the sign man
280,You um definitely was the first person to mention um Derez De'Shon name to me
281,Oh yeah that nigga he's man look that boy he
282,That mighta been a couple months ago
283,maybe
284,that boy's a beast man I g I give credit when credit due Like he really talking about something
285,Mmhm
286,So I'm'a always support
287,Yeah you wo you woulda thought he was kind of um
288,a little bit too real for some of his stuff to pop but
289,I guess
290,with good marketing some of the other stuff he had going along with it and word of mouth
291,It's his time man It was just his time man It's his time man
292,and it's his time
293,Everybody have they time man Timing is everything That why
294,<>
295,that's why people um preach patience so much cause

385,like
386,Okay what is it about his greatness
387,that you're willing to question

389,this shit rigged for Michael Jordan to god damn win all these titles

401,So the game rigged
402,You think the Falcons really was supposed to possibly
403,win if it wasn't for no other extra influence on the game?
404,I mean
405,Taking it that far?
406,I'm not gonna say all that
407,Mmhm
408,but
409,How rigged is rigged? Like if that's the case then the whole everything is rigged from
410,top to bottom every second
411,Man it is though
412,You don't feel like that
413,that's the case with the um
414,the NBA?
415,I mean I feel like the NBA rigged too sometime
416,I mean they go out there and play they games but
417,I mean I don't know I don't really think about it
418,football like that I feel like they doing that with football man with the
419,with the w with the great white hope
420,Ah <>
421,Tom Brady
422,They don't want a Black man to ever be able to reach

42,Decatur GA Okay
43,Yes sir
44,So um
45,is it cool to assume that you been living in Georgia
46,predominantly
47,your whole life?
48,I have
49,Great great great Okay so um
50,growing up in Georgia
51,you know
52,let's start with maybe
53,middle school or something like that What was um
54,growing up in middle school in Decatur Georgia or wherever
55,you was in Georgia in particular?
56,How was it growing up in middle school?
57,Yeah what school you went to?
58,Um I went to RDSCHOOL Middle School
59,Okay
60,U um
61,uh I would say you know life in there was was cool as a African American male Um
62,I'd say it was more not tailored towards uh I wish education just in schoolwise would've been a little more
63,um I guess hands on We would've learned a lot of more
64, Um we
65,I wouldn't say
66,I definitely wouldn't say we were passed along but we could've been uh
67,you know ha
68,<exhale> what is the words? We could've been
69,tightened down on a little more but I think we still got good knowledge and understanding
70,Um a lot of real world situations came in at the time
71,Um
72,just going to the middle school that I went to and it made people kind of look at things in life differently
73,Um
74,but it w it was you know we weren't it wasn't the hood but it was majority African Americans
75,Um so it was like the a it was like the middle class The middle class at that point in time was
76,I'd say was still around in the early two thousands Um now it's kind of fading to more
77,either poverty or rich Um I'd say that was probably the last days of the middle class So
78,um
79,m like I said it was just kind of being a middle class African American
80,you know you had a lot of people who went e either way either they went up to the upper class or they went to the lower class
81,Mm
82,That's that's very very interesting cause
83,I be feeling that way sometimes personally
84,just from my life like dang maybe like
85,almost ten twenty years ago things looked totally different than the way they look kind of right now
86,Um
87,Yeah that quick Correct
88,and I didn't know that that's how
89,it was rocking over in RDSCHOOL Middle
90,M so
91,was that school kind of um
92,fairly new at that time?
93,Oh no
94,Or has that al always been around?
95,Nah that school was very old Uh that sc RDSCHOOL Middle School's been up I know it probably since like the sixties at least
96,Wow
97,maybe the seventies So yeah that school is very old Um
98,Mmhm
99,Yeah definitely was a aged school
100,Okay but um you left
101,old ass RDSCHOOL School to end up going into like
102,new facility RDSCHOOL High School?
103,Um well I w originally went in to RDSCHOOL because RDSCHOOL wasn't built at the time
104,Mmhm
105,Um so when I did go into high school yes I went to RDSCHOOL High School
106,Um it was a brand new facility I would say um
107,it definitely was a new vibe Uh we had a we had a interesting principal when I first started
108,a man by the name of Dr 
109,Um
110,definitely he he kind of
111,embodied what now I wish that more of of the b
112,the educators would have kind of
113,went towards Um I do understand you know he was very tough very uh strict in what he did
114,But now just being a a eld not a elderly man cause I'm definitely not elderly but being a older man I kind of see where his message was going at the time
115,kind of just tried to get our heads on straight Um we did a lot of different things that most schools in DeKalb County didn't do
116,Um it was because of the fact that I do see now too as well um when I first started RDSCHOOL High School
117,it was actually um only ninth and tenth graders there
118,So he was able to handle a less amount of kids He didn't have the typical
119,a thousand
120,fifteen hundred high school in DeKalb County He maybe only had
121,three to four hundred kids that he could control
122,Um and it kind of it started off as good because the majority of the people that I know that did last
123,um that started from the beginning you know are doing something with their selves
124,But then you know it just kind of got
125,that whole thing seemed to get kind of got washed by the wayside and it just kind of turned into the area
126,more than just the greatness of the school
127,Wow okay
128,See um
129,it's been a while since I personally been
130,back to RDSCHOOL almost probably about ten years now
131,So
132,Mm
133,I w I would defer to you f as far as knowing
134,you know how the kids and that culture
135,is over there right about now
136,Um yeah I actually because I DJ as well um I work actually with uh one of the
137,g uh she was a previous coach over there Coach 
138,Um I actually DJ a lot of the uh
139,talent shows and um I've actually done some things for the basketball team
140,um
141,musicwise So I do still go up there occasionally I haven't been up there maybe in about a year or two now
142,um but just kind of keeping my ear to the streets Um I have friends
143,who have kids who are
144,um at RDSCHOOL High School and you know they just kind of said the culture's just completely different
145,from
146,they didn't they don't but of course they wasn't there to know what our culture was But them telling me the culture of what it is now
147,it's completely different from how it was when I was in school
148,Mm
149,Okay
150,Just to um segue away from the school system for a second
151,um
152,tell me a little bit
153,about
154,your parents Like where were they born and raised?
155,Uh my mother was born in Cleveland My dad was born in
156,Detroit Um both of them met in Cleveland
157,and they moved down to Atlanta
158,Okay that's what I'm talking about So
159,they was up in there living the good life up in Cleveland and Detroit
160,and they came down to old
161,Georgia
162,ATL
163,Or
164,or was the good life
165,was it that that good of a life up in Cleveland and
166,Detroit cause I know it's it's kind of different
167,all around
168,Um
169,Did you b
170,did you ever ask about that?
171,I mean I've asked My parents are divorced so of course I can't ask questions that for them to be together so much
172,Mmhm
173,Um but from what I was told I mean Cleveland is just very cold
174,Um it did not have a lot of progressing things going on at the time
175,<>
176,Mm
177,Um I think they came down in like the late eighties mid eighties
178,maybe maybe even early seventies probably like
179,in the eighties some time though
180,Um
181,and when they came down Atlanta Georgia was jumping Um Freaknik was just about to get started you know the kind of
182,Ay okay
183,the the times of Atlanta It was nice and hot The prices of living was cheaper
184,Um there were more jobs here So that's kind of really w it w it what it really was
185,Um they kind of get n wanted to get away from their family members so
186,Mmhm
187,they started something brand new
188,Ah digging that
189,So um
190,you got any plans on
191,what you gonna do with your
192,family life as far as
193,staying in the area or branching out
194,from here?
195,Um I would definitely say that I'm looking into branching out Um I'm currently a
196,single man so I'm not
197,<>
198,worried a so much about family life at the moment
199,Um when that situation does come um of course I don't think I would definitely want them in this area
200,Uh definitely the the the the
201,East Atlanta area has definitely become a
202,not so great area to raise a child
203,Mm
204,Um so I would say raising a childwise I'd definitely go
205,to another area But um at that moment I don't have those issu I don't have those type thoughts So
206,Mm
207,um familywise just it's something that's not really in my head at the moment
208,Nah cool cool cool
209,Feel the same exact way
210,<> even though I do got a girl still
211,you know
212,Right until yeah until other responsibilities are placed in
213,Definitely definitely
214,What you call it again? Um
215,how about siblings?
216,Do you have any?
217,Um I have stepbrothers Um all of my brothers are older than me My dad had previous kids
218,Mmhm
219,um before he had me
220,Mmhm
221,Um
222,three brothers uh
223,all of them are actually well two of them are f college football coaches and one works
224,in uh
225,for the airport's
226,aviation some of the stuff with flying the planes I I don't know the exact title
227,Oh okay
228,And what's your um
229,relationship with them?
230,Cool? Not so cool?
231,Um it's it's alright We have a relationship Um they're a lot older so of course that b uh builds a rift in one
232,Mmhm
233,Um and then because of just family issues how years go down the line pe of course people build rifts for so many other situations
234,Um but it's still all love I still definitely love all of 'em
235,Um you know
236,whenever they need me if they know they really need me they can get in touch with me But
237,um just kind of how family life is Like I said I'm so worried ab
238,I'm not so I'm so focused on
239,what I got going on the fact that they got they own lives in another state doing other things um
240,you know we just all individuals right now They have a closer bond because they share the same
241,mother and father and they around the same age Me who's being the only child by my mother
242,um and raised like a only child I kind of just more to myself
243,That makes a lot of sense I can dig that
244,Let's see Um
245,back
246,going back to the school thing um
247,I guess more so
248,high school How did you get to school?
249,How'd I get to school? Um well
250,because technically th the area that I lived in was never RDSCHOOL area
251,Mm
252,um so
253,it was close enough where I could get there in a short amount of time
254,but it wasn't
255,that wasn't my school I was supposed to be in
256,Mm
257,So typically um my beginning years um
258,friends kind of uh
259,I was always a I would say not a cool kid but I always had friends who d
260,were in the right place at the right time
261,Um kind of had you know people start picking me up
262,and taking me to school
263,Um I wasn't never too far cau f of some days moms would pick me up and take me
264,Um once I got to about like the tenth eleventh grade though it was just about time to take MARTA
265,Um I took MARTA for I'd say maybe
266,??
267,all of my eleventh grade year
268,Um and then uh
269,Wow
270,tenth grade I mean excuse me when I was a senior
271,Mmhm
272,of course I did what every senior in high school does I got me my own car and
273,<>
274,n <> and it was on from there
275,Okay That was a pretty
276,good question then cause I n I don't know I a lot of people just be like oh yeah I just took the cheese bus
277,Uh I mean I t I
278,t I took the cheese but the cheese was m
279,was more in like when I was younger like middle school and high school
280,Definitely
281,Mmhm
282,Actually in middle school I could walk to RDSCHOOL Middle school so I never really had to take the cheese but
283,That's convenient
284,yeah the cheese was just elementary school pretty much
285,Nice nice Um
286,did you have any um favorite subjects or
287,or some subjects you didn't like
288,as much?
289,Um I was always a social studies and science person I love social studies and science knowing about the history
290,and knowing about like uh you know the
291,p t stuff with plants life
292,um you know
293,biospheres uh
294,different the rainforests deserts I've always just like interested in stuff like that Um language arts
295,I mean I can read very well but I just wasn't the
296,I didn't like the literature that they had us reading so I think that's more what made me didn't like language arts
297,Mm
298,Um and math I just never never been the best at math so
299,Mm
300,it wasn't my favorite subject but
301,hey I got B's and C's so I got enough to pass ing
302,<>
303,Yeah that's more than enough for real
304,Right
305,Let's see Um
306,this says friendship group Is there a group of people
307,you hang around
308,with
309,or whatever?
310,Um yeah I had multiple g groups of friends Actually um like I said I was a
311,kind of a
312,g a cool kid or whatever you could say Um
313,I would play baseball so I had a baseball um
314,clique of folks that I hung around with Um
315,Mmhm
316,as well I just had some folks that I knew since middle school
317,Mmhm
318,um and kind of guys that I grew up with I had that group of friends
319,I had a group of friends that were just associated with the neighborhood that I stayed in
320,Um and then I would say I kind of just met friends organically throughout school
321,Um so I had many groups of friends but I would say the main people were the people who I played baseball with
322,and the ones who I grew up with from the middle school
323,to the high school
324,Uh cool cool cool I guess um
325,you know other than baseball what would y'all do together?
326,The middle school friends?
327,Uh unintelligible
328,I mean the talking about the baseball friends?
329,middle school high school a
330,and and the uh
331,Oh just what we would do
332,yeah
333,Um I mean we would kick it We would chill I have a group of friends um especially during the summer time like we played baseball so
334,literally we would kick it and watch baseball the Braves um
335,uh the whole day then get on the video game and play a while
336,um go outside you know
337,it's just enjoy the enjoy the sunshine of course when we were younger
338,Um once we got older it start more of going to different places
339,versus just being outside But when we were outside in middle school and stuff I mean when we were in middle school
340,you know you could just be outside and you could find anything from
341,playing a sport to
342,kicking it on somebody's porch to
343,doing a billion things Um once we got older like I said it was more
344,going to the movies going to the mall uh
345,you know different hang out spots um
346,more than anything
347,Nah definitely
348,definitely feel you on that
349,Let's see What about um
350,your first job?
351,My very first job was at Red Lobster I was a bus boy The Red Lobster on RDADDRESS Road
352,<>
353,Um I graduated high school
354,Okay
355,and uh
356,it was just pretty much time for me to get a job I had certain situations going on in life
357,um where I needed some extra dollars in my pocket
358,I got my graduation money from high school I was able to stack that up get ready to go to college
359,So I worked um the summer of
360,what was that? Two thousand eight at Red Lobster on RDADDRESS Road
361,Oh cool cool cool
362,So um
363,we talking about RDADDRESS Road
364,We talking about RDADDRESS
365,You know this some
366,born and raised type of stuff
367,Do you feel like um that East Atlanta area
368,have a
369,um particular type of dialect and you can possibly tell
370,who's from that area when they talk?
371,Um I would say maybe because I've been here my whole life m
372,I can't
373,because it sounds normal to me
374,Mmhm
375,Um but I would definitely say that when I go to other states
376,definitely people can tell that I'm from the South
377,<>
378,um particularly Atlanta People can kind of really tell especially how when uh you say Atlanta
379,??
380,um people kind of know that alright he's from Atlanta if he say it like that
381,<>
382,Uhhuh
383,Um
384,now
385,this side of town versus maybe like the west side the south side or the north side
386,I don't think it's a difference Um I just think the person may be more a little different versus the way they talk
387,Um the west side do kind of got a real slang hood
388,very like
389,uh real h
390,typical African American
391,stereotyped would of a Black man would be in Atlanta
392,<>
393,Um
394,that's how they're that's the what what sh what people on the TV shows
395,You think so
396,Mmhm
397,a lot of times that's kind of what that more portrays
398,That side now not saying that side hasn't built um
399,Mmhm
400,great people because shi u shit the f
401,previous mayor of Atlanta
402,um
403,Kasim Reed he went to I think Mays High School
404,? okay
405,Mm
406,Um it was one of those high schools on the west side so not to say that they don't have you know
407,very prestigious people but at the same time the typical person from there
408,has a very hood slang country dialect
409,Real heavy right?
410,Very very
411,I I I think that's very very famil um interesting
412,because
413,I done did a few folks
414,from the East Atlanta area
415,and um
416,you're here born and raised I'm here born and raised and stuff like that
417,but I don't
418,necessarily think I have the most
419,Atlanta
420,you know
421,dialect in some certain people eyes and stuff like that When I go out of town
422,or if I'm just around certain people they might be like
423,where you from? I'm from Atlanta
424,What really?
425,Right
426,<> I'm like yeah nigga what the fuck?
427,But um
428,Hm
429,I d I I I get what you're saying with the west side
430,you know not to stereotype but it do seem like you know
431,theirs come out a little bit more
432,than others
433,at times and stuff like that What do you what do you even think
434,just if you had to
435,take a stab at it is the reasoning
436,behind
437,all of that?
438,Uh I mean I
439,the the level of income The west side is typically the poorer place Um the original
440,Mm
441,the original projects of Atlanta the Bowen Homes the
442,Fourth Wards Mechanicsville all that stuff is the west side of Atlanta or a least where the west side of Atlanta begins to start
443,Mmhm
444,Um
445,so a lot of that poverty
446,raised a certain amount o a certain a
447,type of people Again the east side
448,was more
449,middle class than the west side uh
450,so you had a c a few more people who
451,who I would say went more proper took the business route a little more um saw a little more life saw a little more outside of twoeightyfive
452,Mm
453,at a earlier age than versus the west side people
454,So the west side people were typically
455,like I said just the more hood the more
456,the more that way because there's just that's the m that's the p that's the pri uh cost of living around there It was a lot of hoods a lot of projects
457,a lot of
458,crazy stuff going on on that side of town
459,That's um
460,that's interesting that you said the the twoeightyfive thing cause um
461,um somebody
462,sent me um
463,a couple of tracks of their music
464,wanted me to engineer it and whatnot
465,Um
466,Um
467,I said I'll check it out
468,Really didn't have time to but I l I let him know
469,But um as I'm checking out the music
470,um I'm giving
471,them my little feedback
472,or whatever And basically
473,word for word this is what I said
474,Checked out all the tracks
475,and they sound good
476,You're talented
477,My only critique from you
478,from what I heard
479,is that
480,it sound like you haven't spend a day outside of Itwoeightyfive
481,Mm
482,<> And bruh ed He was like appreciate it I'm I'm tryna work on that
483,you know
484,But um
485,which it's nothing wrong with that
486,Right
487,but you know
488,We we just in Atlanta I think because one
489,um I think it's the Mecca right now of African American
490,urban culture
491,Mmhm
492,Um so we feel that
493,because it's like a it loo it seems like it's a melting pot which it is
494,a melting pot of so many places down here in Atlanta
495,Mmhm
496,Um
497,people feel that if you can if you s
498,if you sound like what's hot what's Atlanta quote unquote hot
499,then you s then you'll it'll be what the rest of the world like it'll be what it whatever
500,which we have to understand especially as people who are doing uh
501,uh art
502,cause that's what music is You just being creative and doing your art
503,Like
504,your art gotta be bigger than that You don't want just
505,the people in insi i in Atlanta to buy your music even if you say Georgia
506,you have people across the world just I mean I understand that folks maybe like the Migos
507,Mmhm
508,and Future um but they have a style that they kind of created on there
509,And I wouldn't say that some of it hasn't been
510,?
511,a t stolen or
512,copied a little bit from other people
513,but their style and their flow is their own and that's kind of what
514,they're the more Atlanta
515,they're the originators right now sadly enough
516,Um
517,<>
518,Future has his own lane Uh the Migos have their own lane
519,??
520,TI has their his own lane
521,Um I'm a
522,OutKa well people don't really go to the OutKast lane too much these days
523,They don't but they that's as Atlanta as it gets
524,Right because the right and Kilo Alis and the Pa and well not Pastor Troy cause he's definitely not Atlanta He's more g he's Augusta
525,unintelligible
526,Mmhm
527,Um
528,but those originators from originally from Atlanta that's kind of where
529,because you you do see it where Future you know th hi he kind of it's more musical
530,He has a lot of great production He has a lot of great beats He raps on so many different things Right
531,Dungeon Family
532,because he gets if from that Dungeon Family
533,Mmhm
534,from the Kilo Ali days from the days when Atlanta was more
535,um
536,I would say it was definitely lyrical but it was definitely a vibe It was a beat It was a feel
537,Mmhm
538,Um
539,and even
540,to go all the way down to the Migos um they still now are definitely even more progressing
541,They have that young urban culture
542,They got that kind of
543,already swag with them but you can see now that they're getting a little older they're making more music
544,it's becoming to sound more
545,musical more instruments more um
546,more thought out than just trapping out the bando
547,Nah I I I definitely definitely agree on that
548,You know
549,um
550,I like to say
551,you know people been Atlantanized
552,for real for real especially just
553,Right
554,all over the world
555,Do you feel like um
556,the influence of the music alone
557,is affecting
558,you know the people around in the area that talk this way or do you think it's the people around this area talking of this way that affected the music
559,to be
560,in that type of
561,space?
562,Um I definitely think that how the people are
563,affected
564,the music because that's really what this area is
565,But I think that when it comes to music
566,it's more of what got pushed more
567,than certain things It's not that there's other people in Atlanta
568,who are not making trap music that are great artists that make great music
569,but it's not getting that constant radio push It's not getting that constant
570,uh you know
571,videos and things like that Um
572,which at this point in time now so understandable cause it's it's almost like it's it's function is
573,is already placed in our head that
574,that's what we that's what we gonna enjoy
575,We get
576,sucked in by the TV and all the stuff
577,Um
578,so it's kind of that
579,I will say that words are very powerful
580,um and especially in African American culture
581,um we tend to
582,<ts> we tend to move towards people who give strong words
583,um whether it be
584,a Martin Luther King a Malcolm X a President Obama
585,a Future
586,um
587,whoev if if y if if we can feel your words that's kind of where the group of the people go from even Earth Wind and Fire
588,People really felt those words so
589,that's the kind of words that the people
590,of the times are d are are
591,are moving towards so that's what the times look like
592,Wow
593,It was a lot of love think about it in in the seventies and eighties it was a lot of love music
594,Mmhm
595,so of course there was a lot of more love Don't get me wrong seventies and eighties had its time with
596,the drugs and you know a lot of crazy stuff going on
597,um just with especially with this time in America
598,But it was
599,killings were going on but it was a more peaceful time You didn't have to worry about
600,you know uh
601,a nine a nine year older
602,a nine n excuse me nineteen year old going into a church going into
603,Ah yeah
604,shooting up a concert doing you know
605,Now you did have some crazily racially based things
606,Mmhm
607,um that were
608,t
609,you know we we do understand that that's what the times were and it it definitely isn't right But
610,Mmhm
611,I just think that thi these times are more violent because of things like that It i it's it's the music It's the s it's the different things like that
612,um
613,when it comes to that much
614,So um
615,you know
616,you got a interesting um
617,job being a DJ
618,and you got those feelings of what you feel like
619,how the music could affect people and what you like to listen to and
620,what they might
621,ha
622,like to listen to But I guess
623,I don't know I don't wanna assume
624,as a DJ
625,it's not about what you like or listen to
626,It's about what
627,the people who
628,what
629,supposed to like or whatever What's your thoughts on
630,just that in particular?
631,Um interestingly enough
632,I'm very biased when it comes to DJing
633,Now don't get me wrong I do understand that there are certain songs
634,that um just because they're hot they need to get played
635,But
636,I whe when I DJ my goal is not to make you really listen
637,to the song so much I want you to dance I want you to feel the vibe
638,So
639,I would say
640,the songs that are like uh s for example there's a guy named SixNine out of New York
641,He's has a very hot song but I've probably maybe played that song
642,once or twice ever in my life
643,Um and the two times that I did play it I didn't get the vibe I didn't get the feel
644,Um so I just don't play it anymore
645,Uh
646,and now if there's a special request or someone needed it and they were paying me of course I would play it
647,But I just feel that
648,just because as a
649,we have a responsibility as a DJ to kind of curate what's going on
650,in the music culture So if I constantly keep playing it
651,that's the only reason that people are remembering it Like
652,Mmhm
653,there's certain songs that
654,I mean because especially Atlanta we party from Monday to Monday
655,Mmhm
656,So if you go out one night
657,you you listening to s music the next night you on Instagram the next night
658,and
659,uh you done went out let's say a night after that as well too
660,and then the other night you was working and you was listening to the radio
661,and every single night you heard w it just happened to be one song in particular
662,um
663,you're gonna constantl that song is gonna get stuck with you regardless of how
664,Mmhm
665,regardless of how much you don't want it to or n on or not If you constantly listen to it
666,you will remember the words You will remember the melody You will remember the flow
667,and it's either gonna stick to you one way or another You either gonna like it or you're gonna dislike it Most people
668,because it's all a similar flow
669,like it so
670,Mm
671,if we sit up here and constantly keep playing the BS then
672,eventually
673,<>
674,BS is what's gonna run So that's why
675,like I d I I personally like I have no Famous Dex
676,Mm
677,Um I don't I n I ta I have one Famous Dex song that Pick It Up I think is actually pretty dope
678,Okay I like that
679,Um
680,I don't have many XXXTentacion I have him on the Roll In Peace track
681,Um
682,?? good on that
683,SixNine I don't I like I said I have the one song of his
684,the Gummo um even though he has Billboard tracks
685,Yeah
686,Big shoutout to them you know They're making money and doing whatever they should do in their crowd
687,Um
688,Billboard has to do with a lot of
689,people that are not African American
690,Mmhm
691,so when it comes to that you know hey
692,that mean white people is loving your stuff That doesn't mean our culture is loving your stuff
693,Mmhm
694,Um
695,so like I said I feel that
696,I I I feel like I'm gonna play what's gonna
697,what I enjoy
698,when I play music I sadly enough I'm very biased
699,Mm
700,Sadly enough very biased Um
701,Childish Gambino
702,and
703,CyHi the Prynce are both
704,Atlanta artists
705,Mmhm
706,probably more so East Atlanta artists
707,Mmhm
708,but when I listen to 'em
709,and hear 'em talk
710,I don't really hear
711,you know that Atlantaness I'm I'm hearing like some New York type of stuff coming from CyHi
712,Childish Gambino I'm hearing just some
713,extra left field that don't even sound like a nigga that coulda possibly
714,Right
715,been around the same trap area as some of these other people
716,What's your what's your
717,thoughts on that or just to elaborate more on that?
718,Uh again I think it's m it is the that melting pot thing and it's and it's for us us to understand that
719,music is so much bigger Like that is what's pushed on us
720,There are
721,you can listen to the radio right now in Atlanta and there are probably at least five Migos songs played in a hour
722,If it's not a if it's not a Migos song it's a song featuring a Migo
723,<>
724,You gotta let me check for real ??
725,S
726,Right and and I mean it's it's t it's
727,probably gonna be like that So
728,when you have artists who are from Atlanta who sound different
729,they just don't get that respect because
730,that's n that's not what's being pushed That's not what these big labels because that's o
731,that's the only reason your songs get honestly in rotation in in hip hop which a lot of folks don't know
732,It's coming down from these labels These labels are paying
733,top dollar to these r uh radio exec companies
734,to the top DJ's and the top DJ's are just sending the music out to their crew
735,Mmhm
736,and they're playing the stuff But it's these it's the the m the Migos tracks the Cardi B's tracks
737,the w Future tracks the whatever is hot at the time
738,And typically tracks like the uh
739,the Childish Gambinos and CyHis where it might be more
740,lyrical or might be more eclectic
741,there's just that's not what the companies are tryna fund
742,??
743,unintelligible This what's playing on nine fortyfive right now
744,Um this is actually Jacquees Tha actually this guy's actually literally from the same street
745,that uh was the same main street I was on that I grew up on RDADDRESS
746,Oh wow
747,Um
748,m so I definitely love the fact that you know he's out there Um
749,he has a he's been very talented since he was a kid actually
750,um
751,with his singing So um
752,I definitely love the fact that that's a guy like I said I literally
753,p saw him
754,at a wing spot when he was
755,thirteen twelve years old with a group of other guys around you know singing to females
756,Mm
757,him just singing happy birthdays and stuff like that So um
758,That's tight
759,I definitely love seeing that because I know
760,that's he's on a larger scale right now
761,It's tough for a singer out here right now
762,I would think
763,I would think it is too I just think it's a more about the content in what you singing Um a lot of a l you have to kind of
764,still be hip hop You gotta still sing about
765,Mmhm
766,sex murder drugs and guns you feel what I'm saying You can't really
767,S
768,Yeah
769,nobody's really singing about love anymore because love is so
770,Mm
771,love is so is so
772,cliche r now
773,So many people are falling out of love
774,You got the whole gay thing so you you know that's a whole different type of love
775,um so many divorces
776,and it's not cherished anymore It's kind of more like
777,alright I'm more focused on my money or more focused on my life and my goals than
778,than
779,being in love because being in love
780,doesn't seem to get people far these days it doesn't bring people happiness
781,<>
782,What brings people happiness is money
783,and
784,Mm
785,m sadly enough it's running the world so that's what's running
786,music That's what's running businesses
787,Um that's why you don't get a lot of you know just
788,people
789,giving out I mean think about it Sprint charges you literally
790,or Comcast or these m
791,people you feel what I'm saying literally hundreds and thousands and thousands of dollars
792,and they never say hey you know what? You payed your bill sixteen months in a row
793,on time
794,no matter what You know what? The least we can do is this month we're gonna give you fifty percent off
795,This month we gonna take them the you know take it off
796,Mm
797,Because if the if it was a love thing and if it was appreciation for me
798,us doing business together
799,Mm
800,that's what would happen Because that's what you would do business with anybody After so long
801,you gonna be like hey you know what? Boom
802,But that's not what
803,this country's built off It's built off of it's built off of money It's ran off of money so
804,if it ain't making dollars in they eyes it just don't make sense So
805,and love don't make dollars
806,Oh man just some
807,it was a lot of ways I coulda went with that but
808,I'm I'm gonna
809,go down this lane with it
810,Love dollars
811,but how do you feel about
812,um your experience within the Black community when it comes to business and clients and
813,patronizing them servicewise and I guess
814,as far as them paying
815,like how they wou I guess pay Georgia Power with the rent or
816,some of these other people that might not really definitely don't have no type of love for them What's your
817,thoughts?
818,Um
819,I would just say we are very brainwashed in that sense on who we pay
820,and the services that we allow Um it's kind of funny Again on RDADDRESS
821,there are multiple
822,fast food restaurants horrible restaurants I hate the f hate that
823,Yeah
824,But there's one restaurant that's a ChickfilA on there
825,um and that ChickfilA has probably got the most business
826,probably out of anything on RDADDRESS in all honesty Probably even bigger than the grocery store That ChickfilA might bring in the most business
827,Damn ?? I know
828,Um yeah you know it it could the grocery store might be because it's the grocery store But that ChickfilA probably brings in the most business
829,<>
830,Mmhm
831,and they have
832,excellent service there
833,Now don't get me wrong There's sometimes where
834,you know situations happen where you know this just situations in the area that it's in
835,But it's all about a choice cause it's a mind set
836,Those same people that's working in that ChickfilA
837,are the same people that's working in the Taco Bell across the street There's no difference in really
838,the hiring process or the you know
839,the qu
840,the qualifications you have to have
841,Mmhm
842,But because of
843,how that standard of how that restaurant is ran
844,Mm
845,people
846,only expect certain stuff from that
847,So if we kind of held their own our their own standard to our own businesses and stuff like that
848,And a lot of things folks gotta understand you feel what I'm saying that
849,yes i
850,if we don't spen if we don't spend our own dollar back it doesn't matter
851,how much money we spend with the other folks because eventually we will be wiped out
852,And that's kind of what it seems like they want us to do And that's why a lot of Afri well i sadly enough
853,a lot of African Americans with money
854,they go move into another a neighborhood because
855,the amount of money that's being recycled in a Black neighborhood
856,ain't nothing because the few Blacks that got a little bit of money
857,they go to the white areas They go to the the north side of town to spend their money
858,the s uh you know another side versus
859,you know us kind of saying hey let's build something on this side
860,and keep the money spending in our own neighborhood
861,Wow
862,You brought that shit
863,all the way down
864,<>
865,And I mean
866,from what I seen it it looks to be true
867,I mean I guess
868,I don't know ChickfilA got some good branding when it comes to that cause
869,everybody just know a ChickfilA got some good ass service
870,But I mean
871,they real consistent with it
872,um
873,so it's not you don't think it's more of a issue that the Black business
874,need to go above and beyond even more? Or is it the fact that
875,the
876,the ec
877,the um
878,they
879,Black people are setting the bar too high for other Black people
880,as far as
881,they service and stuff that they don't even give that same type of consideration
882,to the white
883,or
884,you know other categories?
885,I think that we do kind of hold
886,in our heads for whatever reason other
887,businesses to a higher standard because there are businesses in
888,the East Atlanta area where
889,um
890,Mmhm
891,where uh
892,Black businesses where they are thriving Um there's one in particular a seafood spot It's actually a house
893,that they turned into a restaurant called Wats Crackin
894,um on Candler Road

131,Actually take your right foot and left foot and you do what you supposed to do to get there
132,Uh I don't really
133,consider a lot of people friends I have a lot of associates
134,Because I feel like a friend is somebody that you should be able to call on and rely on
135,in like the toughest times of your life and
136,if it's only for me to just
137,party with you
138,um yeah not

144,All while still heading towards um individual goals
145,and
146,just still you know helping each other and things like that So
147,<ts>
148,that's the type of friends
149,I have and I could count them on one hand
150,Yeah
151,Yeah same here
152,pretty much
153,So
154,those f
155,friends that you was just mentioning are they around in this area or back in New York somewhere else?

164,Um and the last person is my boyfriend

169,Oh okay cool
170,He's my boyfriend and my best friend
171,Okay awesome
172,awesome
173,One of the five
174,<>
175,One of the five okay
176,excluding me w I guess maybe
177,one more of your recent friends how did you meet them?
178,Um
179, I met her at RDWORK She came in to
180,get a job and I was working there She's a little bit younger than me
181,But um we connected on
182,the purs
183,purpose of us both living in New York even though she's from the Bronx
184,And um
185,yeah that's about it She's cool and her parents are from the Caribbean too
186,But a different you know they're from Jamaica
187,And my parents from St Vincent so we could kind of like
188,I don't know connect on that part and she's a gogetter like me
189,Need a couple kicks just because she's younger but
190,you know
191,in the right direction not actual kicks
192,But like
193,yeah
194,I think that's why we connected and that's where I met her
195,Okay so you mentioned um
196,one of your jobs being working at
197,RDWORK s
198,store How long were you working there for?
199,About a year
200,A year and some
201,well yeah like a year and some months probably like four four months or so
202,I've stopped counting
203,Okay okay cool cool So um
204,how do you get to work?
205,<ts>
206,Usually for me to get to work I have to take a Uber 
207,I take a Uber to work
208,cause I don't have a car right now
209,And I don't have my license so I am working on
210,obtaining that that license so I could then work on getting me a car
211,Cause it's totally different like in New York you have your
212,transportation train station you don't need none of that extra stuff everything is kind of on your doorstep
213,And out here you have to actually
214,um have a car to get from
215,place to place cause everything is so far out and expanded
216,But yeah that's what I use And sometimes my sister will take me and sometimes
217,you take me My boyfriend will take me So
218,you
219,Cool cool cool
220,So um
221,did you eat today? What you have for breakfast?
222,For breakfast we did
223,a dinner thing <>
224,We had like um
225,bowties linguine bowties with um
226,<ts>
227,tomato sauce but we cut the peppers up and everything in there
228,and added some spices and some butter
229,And then we also had corn on the cob and black beans
230,with some onions and peppers and yeah as well as some spices So it tasted really good
231,It filled me up
232,Mm
233,Mm
234,Mm that sound good
235,<>
236,S <>
237,That's alright I know it tastes good too I mean but um
238,what
239,that's a pretty unique choice for a breakfast dish I kn I know it I mean it's no time
240,like the present to have a good meal or whatever but um
241,is there a reason
242,your dish is like that? Is it a particular diet you're in?
243,No I'm well I'm a vegetarian
244,Okay
245,Vegetarian not vegan Vegans don't really eat like
246,um they don't drink milk They don't do anything with dairy and a lot anything that came from or started with an animal
247,is no longer ate by a vegan but I still of
248,occasionally do fish
249,Um I just stay away from meat
250,period Like chicken you know steak hamburgers those type of stuff I stay away from those
251,And I just um try to eat healthy and keep my body balanced
252,What kind of prompted you to
253,start eating I guess cleaner as a vegetarian more so?
254,Um I started being a vegetarian when I was in New York City and I think it was because I was getting more aware of
255,things that were happening with the animals
256,That's what first prompted it
257,um just
258,you know machines that they stick down their throats so they could eat and
259,give them their vitamins and
260,all the estrogen that goes into animals and sometimes too much testosterone
261,And I believe whatever a animal eats we consume as well
262,Cause then they're killing them for us to eat them which is
263,you know the way God created it but at the same time
264,it's like
265,they just put in way too much into the animal They're not getting it from the earth anymore
266,Mm
267,It's
268,it's like mass produced and nasty so that's what kind of prompt me to do it
269,And then I was never really was like a meat lover anyways
270,So it wasn't hard for me to like transition from
271,<ts>
272,basically
273,just eating
274,you know maybe hamburger once in a while to not having any meat at all
275,I'm a fish person so
276,Nah cool cool Any um I guess good
277,I wouldn't wanna say the word side effect but I guess benefits of coming from
278,Your skin is much clearer
279,Okay
280,Um
281,your skin's much clearer you feel you get more energy
282,Uh you just feel lighter and like it's
283,it's k
284,Okay what can I equate it to is like
285,when I do a mask on my face
286,and it's just cleaning out all my pores and everything
287,And I'm my face doesn't feel cloggy anymore It's kind of like that like you don't feel stuffed
288,Your stomach's not all protruding
289,You feel light and heavy and you could have more meals a day
290,than feeling like
291,I don't know
292,like Santa Claus I guess
293,<>
294,If it just it just did so much better for my skin and I don't feel as sick as I used to
295,Okay
296,from whatever was in my body
297,Okay
298,Let's see let's um switch the whole
299,aura of the
300,interview right now What um
301,are some shows that you're interested in
302,right now?
303,Um let's see
304,I can't wait for Game of Thrones to come back out
305,Oh I love that
306,love that show
307,I love Game of Thrones
308,I cannot even
309,remember what happened in the last season Have to
310,redo it But I like that I like Blackish
311,Okay
312,Um what's another show? Oh Star that new one from Lee Daniels that's really good
313,Uh I watch Power
314,Um
315,<ts>
316,I watch
317,reality TV
318,I like Vanderpump Rules
319,Uh what else? Love and Hip Hop
320,sometimes I watch that
321,Not too much into this season
322,And what's another show I really really really I like movies a lot though
323,Let me see what's another show that I watch all the time?
324,I can't remember
325,I know that I watch
326,oh I watch um the Kardashians
327,<>
328,<>
329,What what's what's what do you find fascinating about watching the Kardashians?
330,I think
331,I okay I can only talk ? for myself but I'm obsessed with all things hair and like eyebrows and stuff like that
332,And so I've was watching them since season one they came a long way
333,And ing
334,I just like seeing them as a family getting that money together
335,That motivated me and um
336,<ts>
337,just the way they look
338,I think it's a thing about looks because
339,with girls like
340,I know when I was little I had thousands of Barbie dolls
341,But
342,to you they mighta all looked the same and to me they didn't look the same
343,So I think that's
344,our obsession with like the Kardashians like
345,they yeah people might think like they're fake or whatever
346,But you know
347,<ts> they just look different They look like dolls like you watching
348,<>
349,dolls on TV
350,Yeah a couple of 'em
351,pretty cute
352,Hm
353,They cute yeah
354,I would say
355,I just like watching it I know
356,it might be not be all the way
357,true or whatever I don't really know but I like watching it
358,Nah it's it's good to get some type of um entertainment
359,you know
360,gotta enjoy your life at times
361,Mmhm and then I also watched the Mariah Carey one that's on there got me to s
362,see her in a different light
363,Um
364,some lights I don't like but
365,Mmhm
366,<> she's uh
367,I she's interesting I like
368,watching people on TV I like to see interviews too like on OWN on A Oprah
369,Like when she's interviewing like people like John Legend Will Smith
370,you kind of get wisdom from these type of people So that's my channel I go to when I really wanna
371,learn somebody's background and
372,why people think the way they do and
373,everybody's different so
374,it's good to
375,<ts>
376,like if there's a person you don't like like
377,okay like
378,I wouldn't say I don't like her but cause I don't know her but like
379,Miley Cyrus
380,like the interview for me
381,I don't think she interviewed her but if she interviews her
382,I would get to see like why
383,she does certain things
384,You know
385,what makes her tick
386,as Miley Cyrus cause
387,some things she does I might not agree with and some things I do
388,she might not agree with but that's what makes us us different so
389,I like the OWN channel
390,Agree okay
391,Mmhm
392,So with um I guess
393,for some of these interviews some of these people that you're
394,checking out their stories and
395,Mm
396,I guess you know you can relate with some experience in your stories
397,How much do you think family affect a person's
398,you know outcome
399,personality character all that different type of stuff?
400,I think that's the biggest
401,that's the biggest um
402,<ts>
403,that's the b
404,t what's the word I'm looking for?
405,That's the place where you learn
406,how to do everything and how the world's gonna treat you
407,And um sometimes if you come from
408,a dangerous background you so used to seeing everybody
409,like being violent with one another you think that's the way it sup
410,that everybody's household is You know cause you don't have that
411,perspective You don't have that person telling you like oh no
412,it's different other places and
413,it's not like that or
414,whatever But
415,I know I grew up with just like my mom
416,And I always lived with um
417,<ts>
418,we always shared like a home In New York City you could have like three family homes
419,So it would be like me and my mom and then my aunt
420,and her daughter and two sons
421,and her husband So it's like I always had
422,family members there but not really Like I still know I was the only child
423,but I call them my brothers and sisters
424,But
425,I don't know
426,I think I had more of a of a different upbringing than say like somebody who was actually a only child
427,and they didn't have like siblings around Like
428,I had
429,the best of both worlds Like
430,if I wanted to se be by myself I could be by myself If I wanted to be around kids I could be around kids
431,<ts> And it just showed me that um I could be multifaceted and be
432,friends and still be comfortable and not always have somebody on my side So
433,I don't know and then my family's weird so
434,I don't know
435,Okay
436,Yeah
437,What kind of traditions
438,do you remember having in your family
439,if any?
440,Traditions
441,Oh sitting down for Thanksgiving
442,dinner we'd say
443,what we were thankful for every year and how it was gonna improve for the next year
444,Um what else? Food is a big traditions in our house
445,So like we have macaroni pie
446,We have like the corn pie we always have um oxtail
447,Mmhm
448,Love it
449,Um food brings us together That's what I noticed with our family like
450,food and parties
451,Mmhm
452,So that's
453,mostly our traditions
454,We don't really do nothing major l oh and like
455,my birthday is a tradition ing
456,Okay
457,<>
458,I just like going to the movies and to eat
459,Ah nice nice
460,Yeah it's nothing like too extravagant until I get to travel but
461,I don't really do the whole birthdays thing maybe one year but not
462,not anytime soon
463,Do you plan on
464,you know keeping these traditions alive
465,alive with your own family that you start or whatever?
466,Definitely But I want us to be closer I want us to talk about like our day and I want us to have like a positive word jar
467,where like we put write something positive ing
468,um everyday and then you put it in a jar and then every Sunday we'll pull one out and read it
469,And um I wanna do something like that
470,I wanna start funds like saving funds for my kids so I can help them you know early on start it early on so I can help them later on in life
471,And what else? What else?
472,I definitely wanna have like
473,a cooking thing like once a month where we can invite our friends and they can eat with us
474,So we not all
475,<ts>
476,into each other
477,you know bring other people into our world
478,And just teach our kids to be
479,loving towards one another as brother and sister
480,Cause me and my
481,t s um
482,god sister and my
483,god brother my cousins whatever you wanna call them
484,We're kinda harsh towards one another but I think that's a New York thing But
485,I'm gonna teach them to be a little softer and nicer with each other
486,<ts>
487,That's nice That's cool
488,Um
489,so
490,you got a real unique perspective coming from New York living
491,so many years and also coming to Atlanta
492,living so
493,many years Atlanta is becoming like a melting pot of a lot of different
494,types of variety of people and we already know
495,That was kind of New York's
496,claim to fame as well
497,Tell me about
498,growing up in neighborhoods in
499,New York
500,What type of neighborhood were you grow up have you grown up in?
501,Um when I was younger I was living in RDADDRESS
502,Um that's part of Brooklyn
503,Um
504,RDADDRESS do or die
505,Home of Biggie Smalls
506,<>
507,Yeah
508,and Jay Z down a couple blocks in RDADDRESS projects And it was really bad around that time so
509,Mm
510,even though my grandmother had a home
511,um my mom and
512,her sisters didn't really grow with their mom so make to make the long story short we ended up leaving
513,and we got our own spot in RDADDRESS
514,I think we moved to
515,no RDADDRESS yeah we moved to RDADDRESS That's in Brooklyn too
516,And I grew up in that
517,area for like
518,ten to
519,twelve years probably longer can't really remember
520,But um
521,it's different
522,seeing as everything is around the corner like if I come out the house I don't gotta stay in the house all day
523,I go outside
524,the corner store is there You got your shop your shoes stores You got your Duane Reade's your Rite Aid's
525,um your CVS's It's just totally different like
526,everybody's always outside playing on the block
527,Um
528,<ts>
529,It's just nice It's just different It's just a different feeling like
530,everything is right where you need it whereas out here
531,um
532,you come outside all you see is your neighbors all you gonna see is your neighbors
533,And if you come out the area all you gonna see is the woods unless you downtown or whatever
534,Okay
535,And um
536,True that
537,There's no corner stores Y'all have QT's
538,Mmhm
539,Um you need your car
540,to go past the outside of your your area whatever that might be
541,And yeah everybody down here is about their home They not really more so about fashion
542,Up there we about fashion Like
543,cause you walking all the time you gotta look fresh you have to have your fresh sneaker on your fresh outfit on If you're a girl your hair have to be done your nails gotta be done
544,And you not gonna be get caught dead going in certain stores I see people
545,who going in and out here
546,like it's nothing
547,So yeah we more about our clothes Y'all more about like homes and stuff
548,Okay
549,um
550,<ts>
551,between
552,I guess New York
553,and your experience in Atlanta
554,which would you
555,consider safer?
556,Safer?
557,Yes
558,Mm
559,I guess um
560,I feel a little bit safer in New York I think that's cause I grew up there though
561,Like down here it was something I seen on TV
562,And I feel like the houses are nice but they kind of just right there and anybody could just come into your joint
563,Whereas up there like everybody's connected
564,The houses are connected
565,So it's like
566,they're not w
567,they not gonna try you
568,like how they try people out here like
569,just going in they houses taking TV's and shit
570,Cause we just so close knitted up there Even if we didn't want to be that's just the way that it's built
571,So
572,yeah breathy
573,That makes sense so
574,it's a lot more crowded up there
575,than
576,in Atlanta
577,I think it's the same
578,Well f
579,no yeah it's crowded
580,It's crowded but it doesn't after fi I feel like it's the same thing on a block
581,radius type thing
582,It's the same amount of people It's just that
583,your neighbors are much closer
584,Like okay
585,you step outside on your porch they porch is right there Like
586,there's a
587,gate dividing your porch and their porch But when you come out and they stand there you're gonna say hey
588,Mmhm
589,Versus out here we have to wave across the street or wave
590,Mmhm
591,next door There's space in between your houses so
592,I don't know I don't
593,I don't think it's more crowded I think it's the same amount of people
594,actually It's just that everybody
595,kind of is on the go in they own cars and stuff out here so you not really gonna
596,bump into that many people unless you take the a
597,the MARTA
598,Okay so
599,eh
600,in your neighborhood
601,let's say back in New York
602,did you go to a school that was close by or did you have to go all the c
603,Mmhm
604,way across town or something?
605,Oh no my school was always in the vicinity
606,Okay
607,Um when I was in junior high my school was across the street
608,All I d I literally all I had to do was cross the street and go to school
609,I think my mom and my aunt did that on purpose
610,And then when I got to high school
611,um I just had to walk up
612,let me see
613,like five blocks And then we moved to another place so I was walking
614,um just ten blocks But it was in the same type of
615,zone area like you had to go to your zone school
616,Um I think in high school you could go to other schools but you had to have like a problem or your parents just wanted you to go to an elite school or something like that But
617,we have zone schools just like out here
618,Um
619,<ts> they were always in the area
620,Only one time
621,I think up from kindergarten to third grade
622,I was
623,in um RDSCHOOL
624,and that was
625,over on RDADDRESS Street
626,out of my neighborhood
627,But that was because I was in a Catholic school and then she decided to change my school
628,And that's when I moved over to the RDADDRESS school
629,public school
630,because she felt what th
631,I wasn't learning anything at the Catholic school
632,Mmhm
633,They was just taking the money
634,Okay
635,So um
636,what was your favorite school I guess in particular that you went to?
637,I didn't like school
638,Mmhm
639,I think my whole experience in school
640,I really loved um kindergarten
641,Mmhm
642,cause we ing
643,we didn't do anything ing We took naps
644,That's awesome
645,um colored
646,And some people don't remember like kindergarten but I remember it because I had
647,a special needs teacher
648,Mmhm
649,She was a helper for my my teacher was Indian
650,She looked like Pocahontas
651,That's all I can remember
652,<>
653,And the
654,special needs teacher she was a little person
655,Mmhm
656,And her name was Miss  She was so nice She was like
657,the height of probably my knee and I'm just five five feet
658,five feet She was up to like my thigh
659,Oh
660,She was tiny
661,Mmhm
662,<ts>
663,She was so nice She used to bring me candy all the time so I really love
664,kindergarten and rest in peace Miss 
665,Mmhm
666,And then let's see I really loved um I think that was fifth grade
667,no sixth grade I met this guy he was my teacher His name was Mr 
668,Really on the hefty side rest in peace Mr 
669,Mmhm
670,But he really um motivated us to be good people
671,Mmhm
672,It wasn't just about singing with him
673,It was more about like um
674,you know f getting to know you and love yourself as a person so he motivated me I really liked that class That was a music class
675,And that made me have a love for music
676,And then
677,let's see
678,I don't think I had any favorites in high school
679,What about some teachers you just couldn't stand
680,like ah
681,Oh
682,there's
683,there's teachers
684,Mr 
685,<
686,in
687,RDSCHOOL two eleven
688,Couldn't stand his ass
689,<>
690,Oh my bad
691,Nah you good
692,My mom um
693,she had to go up there and speak to him because he wouldn't let me sit in the front of the class
694,My glasses I didn't have my glasses I wear glasses to see the board I would tell him everyday I can't see And then he'll be mad that I didn't turn in my work and stuff like that
695,Well it's like I can't see And then he told me he was not gonna put me in the front of the class
696,So she came up there and gave him a little
697,one two
698,type of mama cursing type thing
699,and then I was in the front of the class the next day
700,<> Man ma
701,um
702,Mrs 
703,Mmhm
704,I think that was her name She was a ra that was the first time I had to deal with racism
705,in NYC But she basically used to pick on certain people and tell us
706,like
707,oh you're doing this and I'm'a tell your parents you're doing this and you weren't doing it
708,And I remember one time she told
709,my mom I was in the class jumping on the desk throwing
710,my erase the erasers at her or something like that
711,Mmhm
712,And Mr  had to come and help me out
713,and kind of
714,tell my mom she needed to get me out that class cause
715,she just don't like certain people When she got her mind on you
716,she ain't gonna like you So those are two people I had
717,an
718,awful experience with in school But school just
719,Mmhm
720,it wasn't my thing I wanted to
721,get out and do what I wanted to do but the crazy thing was
722,I didn't know
723,what exactly I wanted to do so
724,I was just always all over the place
725,Did you have any um
726,favorite subjects?
727,English I could write a essay like nobody's business I used to
728,help people write their essays cause I was really good at it
729,It was just common sense to me
730,Okay
731,Mmhm
732,Um
733,social studies and then there was another class we used to take
734,and it taught us how to predict the weather
735,Mmhm
736,I can't remember the name of that class but it was really fun The teacher was really good I can't remember his name though
737,That was a really good class
738,What'd they call that?
739,When you with the weather?
740,Uh meteorology or something like that
741,Something like that yeah I really liked that
742,??
743,And then I took drama class in college
744,That was fun and weird at the same time I think I wasn't ready for at that point
745,Mmhm
746,because I didn't know that like in acting class you have to act like a
747,like get on all fours and act like a cat and
748,<>
749,do all type of stuff And I just I was too concerned about how I was looking
750,Mmhm
751,than to be focused on my craft So that didn't last long
752,Mm
753,So would that be considered
754,I'm I know that's a course but it was there any other
755,extracurricular activities in school?
756,<ts>
757,In high school no
758,Okay
759,I tried out for the track team
760,but I had some issues with
761,pain
762,in my leg and stuff I guess that
763,is genetics I don't know
764,Oh
765,And then um
766,I wasn't really into like
767,cheerleading because
768,I'm I feel like I'm a leader and
769,the stuff that they were doing to the
770,people who were auditioning like it was some type of sorority I was just not gonna pass that test like
771,Mmhm
772,so I kind of just stayed
773,to myself I didn't really do anything extracurricular in school
774,Didn't wanna do it
775,even when I was younger and I would say oh I wanna do tap dancing
776,And my mom would take me to tap dance class and then when I realized she couldn't stay with me I would cry And then
777,I just went home So I just never was interested in anything I'm a really clinger I cling to my mom
778,Mmhm
779,<ts>
780,And um
781,I cling to anything that's
782,that I feel comfortable with so whether that be
783,my mom my sister somebody close And if they're not with me I have a issue so
784,<ts>
785,yeah
786,Definitely a clinger
787,Definitely a Klingon
788,<>
789,<>
790,Um what you call again?
791,Let's see
792,go a little bit deeper cause
793,usually a lot of people when they come to Atlanta for about five years they
794,they become ATLiens and they kind of adapt the flavor and the swag but you really
795,I don't wanna adapt y'all flavor and swag
796,you really holding on to this NY
797,you know dialect
798,and culture
799,I don't have I don't know how to pick up y'all dialect Like
800,I don't really hang out with
801,Mmhm
802,Atlanta people
803,like that Not it's no offense to any person that's from Atlanta but I just haven't come across like somebody that I could relate to and understand why
804,you know Atlanta women act the way they do
805,Mmhm
806,And so the few I have met I just I don't mess with them like that cause
807,I don't know It's clashing Like they views and my views
808,So um
809,Go deeper like
810,what's the difference? Like you can tell somebody
811,from New York
812,by the way they walk or they talk
813,No because
814,I don't know like I'm picky with my friends in general
815,in New York City so
816,Mmhm
817,um when I came out here I met one girl She was from
818,New York
819,and she lived out here for like over ten years or something like that
820,But to me she was more into like the guys with the cars and
821,if they ain't go no money they ain't gotta talk to her
822,<>
823,And like things like that and I'm just
824,I'm not saying there's not girls like that in New York cause they are
825,Mmhm
826,And I didn't hang out with them there either
827,Okay
828,So it just depends on for me energy
829,and where your um opinions
830,lie like I'm not gonna not be your friend because
831,you want a guy with money or whatever But
832,if that's all you're concerned about and I see you not working for so for something for yourself that's how I choose my friends And
833,I think that's the difference between
834,me a New York person and them a ATL person
835,I just haven't found that right Atlanta person that
836,Okay
837,you know I wanna hang out with
838,besides you
839,True
840,true
841,And I can't lose this accent if d
842,<>
843,I feel like I was there my whole life I came out here and wi in my
844,when I was like twentyeight or something like that So my accent is stuck It's not going nowhere
845,I'm not tryna pick up no other accent unless I go to London or something like that
846,Okay
847,nah nah nah it's that's fair But um
848,I know you're least able d to
849,decipher
850,the some of the lingo and the language that Atlanta people use What is some that you're familiar with
851,that you just know Atlanta people use
852,all day everyday?
853,Bruh?
854,Bruh
855,See y
856,so you're you're you're stating that bruh came from Atlanta?
857,I think bruh came from Atlanta
858,I think bruh came from Atlanta too
859,Bruh came from Atlanta um
860,Bruh is nationwide worldwide right about now too
861,um what else do y'all say? Finna
862,What else?
863,Finna?
864,Oh okay that's a Atlanta thing?
865,I'm f I'm finna go to I'm finna go to the store
866,Store
867,<>
868,Y'all say skreet
869,Skreet with a K
870,up in there
871,Y'all say Merry Chritmas nonstandard pronunciation
872,Chritmas
873,Okay
874,When I used to come out here on vacation I used to hear a lot more Like it had more a lot of that
875,like ATLiens walking around like
876,Mmhm
877,ayo shorty shorty
878,can I shorty can I s see you for a minute or whatever like
879,<>
880,Oh lemme ho lemme holler at you for a second shorty
881,Some shit like that
882,You got any uh funny stories about
883,you know language or I guess some
884,ATL guys tryna holler at you?
885,<ts>
886,Um
887,I only remember that one time when my friends was following um
888,what's his name? Master P's son?
889,Lil' Romeo?
890,Yeah they was following him
891,And um I felt like that was weird That's a lot of stuff people do out here that's weird too
892,Mmhm
893,So they following him following him in these stores in Lenox mall
894,Mmhm
895,And I know he saw them following him So when they finally caught up to him I just went up the escalator
896,You're too cool for that huh?
897,You know
898,yeah cause I just
899,I wasn't interested in even meeting him like
900,<>
901,so ing he kind of was looking up and ing and waving
902,Mmhm
903,You know instead of paying attention to them and
904,taking a picture
905,Oh and I also met Shaq but he's not from out here

196,I don't like him
197,I mean <>
198,<>
199,To me he's
200,has money but he's rather
201,ignorant
202,Mm
203,I wouldn't have
204,picked him as a president
205,or a friend
206,or
207,an associate
208,or a neighbor
209,or anything
210,Definitely
211,But um

215,what about um
216,I
217,I know
218,where your stance is on politics What about religion?
219,<ts>
220,Hm
221,Well I'm a Christian Um
222,I'm actually a pastor
223,prophetess so
224,Oh wow
225,Not so much as religion but I'll say I'm
226,big on believers cause
227,I go according to the bible and the bible says don't be overly religious
228,So I have morals and ethics and I follow them
229,<ts>
230,Commandments
231,you know
232,I believe in God
233,Jehovah Jireh Jehovah Nissi Jehovah Rapha
234,Jehovah Shalom
235,Oh wow okay
236,Learning now
237,That's cool
238,Right
239,Um
240,<>
241,There's a powerful energy in this
242,in the air right about now
243,Right
244,Okay
245,I got a question
246,<clears throat>
247,Another one?
248,Okay
249,Another one
250,<>
251,Okay
252,Yes
253,Okay do you ever at any point in time feel
254,music wise
255,y
256,you would be at a much
257,um
258,more mainstream success appeal if
259,you had a different type of character
260,than the one
261,you have now?
262,Um
263,Or if that is
264,uh something that's actually a roadblock for you
265,your character
266,is keeping you from having mainstream
267,success in your music?
268,No because it's a lot of independency going on these days Um
269,what really kept me from being mainstream in my music I think was really obstacles in my life Um one of the main things was bad relationships
270,<ts>
271,And it kind of caused me to be stagnant or deal with jealous people or put other people on the forefront
272,because I tend to
273,have a big heart But um
274,<ts> no my music is very versatile It's very mainstream Like I said I'm not religious so
275,I'm able to deliver and still have fun and not really part feel a particular way about it I believe that God is my only judge but
276,because I am a believer it keeps me from getting caught up in selling my soul or doing anything just to
277,get higher on the music
278,Richter scale I guess would be the good word
279,Okay
280,It's pretty transparent
281,Makes sense to me
282,Right
283,Music wise right now who you like?

400,kicking and stuff like that
401,<> It's some real wrestling techniques out there
402,yeah it's a lot of training in that and a lot of times you gotta be real muscular
403,That helps big time
404,It not if you're a female That's definitely manly looking
405,That's definitely hurts
406,Yeah breathy
407,<>

453,No
454,It's not the best money

456,I'm thinking some of these strippers out here really be getting doctor money out here
457,yeah they may but they're doing a little bit more than
458,stripping or exotic dancing would be the technical term So
459,the lifestyle that comes with it definitely is not appeasing
460,True
461,true that true that true It's a lot of fast living right there
462,Mm definitely and bad reputations
463,Oh reputations is
464,very um important

478,attacking him like
479,it is true

481,anything past anybody on that aspect because I had a kind of
482,bad experience
483,Oh my gosh whispered
484,with that
485,So um
486,people that you would not imagine to do things like that actually could so

497,ever in the same place at the same time Just
498,I was
499,We definitely know God knows though
500,We definitely know that God knows
501,Something's definitely going on
502,when he's
503,in court that much
504,Oh damn
505,I fee I per I I don't know maybe I'm a conspiracy theorist I
506,personally think the powers that be could have enough power
507,to pull that off and have the media
508,you know convince us whatever
509,They definitely could I mean it's happens a lot They did it with OJ Simpson and they still talk about him and
510,Why they still talk about that?
511,even Tiger Woods and
512,I just don't understand why when one person comes forward a whole bunch of people do Like if you're a serial rapist
513,why don't
514,people find out until you're a lot older?
515,It's weird
516,Very very weird
517,But it's a lot of stuff about that joint that's
518,that's just weird though But I mean I guess
519,that's kind of Hollywood too
520,at the same thing
521,So are you trying to in a sense
522,keep from saying Illuminati?
523,Nah nah We could say Illuminati but I mean I don't know what the Illuminati is so that's why I don't even wanna say
524,Mm okay
525,Illuminati like that
526,Oh okay
527,Hm
528,Cause it could be know you know one percenters or the
529,whoever else
530,I don't know I just think it's the world and it's corrupt and it's a big facade just like this JayZ and Beyonce thing They're getting a divorce and breaking up Now they're having twins

833,I do in home nursing
834,Yeah
835,So um I only work with my patients and submit my time and my task sheets so
836,Man that i
837,it's pretty cool
838,that is so
839,boss
840,Um
841,Yeah
842,How do you say so um
843,are you organized?
844,In what?
845,To be able to like um
846,multitask and do all these different things
847,Oh
848,I would say so
849,Okay
850,That's woah That's what's up
851,Feel like females just got a
852,better
853,advantage when it come to
854,organizing and multitasking
855,Why is that?
856,I have no idea
857,Just seem like y'all get it a lot easier
858,Um I
859,wouldn't say so myself
860,Oh yeah?
861,No
862,<>
863,think whoever
864,puts in the most effort
865,would be the ones that get it
866,It's all about your grind your hustle You know what's your hustle?
867,What's your hustle?
868,What?
869,Right
870,<>
871,Right
872,Productions
873,Dang
874,What about
875,your grind and what you get a out of it It's just what it is right?
876,So you don't think it's situations where you like
877,but just like is the juice worth the squeeze or something?
878,Um
879,somethings you can grind longer for
880,you know It's all about consistency I would say what you stay down for
881,Mm
882,Some people think it takes too long so they give up
883,Just like with praying you know If it doesn't happen people lose faith but
884,whatever you do you got to stay down with it Cause it's probably several other people doing the same thing
885,So
886,I would say marketing and persistence
887,Why you gotta stay down? Why you can't stay up?
888,Because if you stay up
889,then you never get any rest to recoup
890,So sometimes you gotta stay down
891,Ooh
892,Hoo hoo hoo hoo
893,That's real right there
894,Mm yeah
895,<ts>

917,I don't know
918,but
919,you definitely giving me that
920,that look

15,a kind of different
16,type of interview
17,It's gonna be a lot of free styling but I got in mind
18,how I
19,wanna conceptually wrap this up
20,We gonna be speaking for
21,briefly
22,fortyfive minutes or so
23,Um
24,but really it's just more
25,for them to get a understanding of your linguistics This the linguistics department so they wanna
26,Mmhm
27,I guess
28,understand how you
29,say your words and
30,all that different type of stuff
31,So you know
32,just relax be you be normal
33,We just gonna
34,continue our conversation
35,Okay
36,and um I'll just keep you
37,posted with the check times but um yeah
38,Told me your name
39,How old are you?
40,I'm forty years old
41,And I need like you know
42,I know that's not a long
43,drawn out type answers but give me a couple of those when it
44,Ooh
45,Oh yeah yeah yeah
46,when it calls for it
47,I mean you know how it go I mean
48,Forty man
49,like uh y
50,<exhale> for f for one thing
51,I mean
52,like my birth name
53,in particular
54,I don't really like using it that much you know what I'm saying I like
55,to use
56,my other titles
57,well not really other titles but
58,other personifications how I see myself
59,you know
60,But I know your birth name is attached
61,to the universe like that's the first label that you get
62,when you come into this life so I'm not ashamed of my name neither
63,It's just
64,what people do with people's names nowadays
65,from identity theft to
66,I know
67,cats that been stopped
68,and used
69,other people's names
70,in
71,you know
72,situations that they put themselves in where they can't
73,h well or or they don't have enough courage
74,Mmhm
75,to just take a L
76,You know what I'm saying so they'll put your name
77,cause they know you real good They'll say oh my name is so and so
78,you know they get them to skate I know people who been caught up like that
79,Yeah
80,And then you know identity theft all that stuff
81,So
82,I just try not to use my birth name but I know that's
83,the most I can't change that
84,about myself You can change your name
85,legally
86,and it w still won't matter because
87,yeah you f changed your fate
88,somewhat but your birth right name
89,that wasn't given to you by mistake That was given to you on purpose
90,Because when you enter this system you got karmic laws
91,that you have to co
92,to play out
93,Mm
94,because the system is broken
95,The system
96,is trying to take a whole thing which is you the true you
97,and break you down So it's like
98,if I tell you you gotta come in my crib for example
99,it's like
100,before you come in here
101,you gotta carry those bags outside
102,Then you gotta carry my bags
103,then you gotta go through the bags and sort all my clothes out for me
104,Then you gotta wash 'em
105,then you gotta d go buy me some new clothes When I don't like if I don't like a couple of pieces then you gotta go
106,like it's all these strings attached to it when you enter the system And some
107,people come with less
108,because they know the system a little better so they say uhuh you ain't gonna put that on me
109,But the system is like
110,you know the system is a fractalization It's like
111,a body
112,Like I used to hear people say
113,a body is a temple
114,Nah a body is a prison
115,You have to make it a temple
116,All these millions and trillions and billions of cells in your body
117,that's a lot to keep track of
118,And once they start getting infected
119,then you got like this
120,this battle going on with inside of you
121,You know what I'm saying if your body was really perf perfected
122,you wo you shouldn't be getting sick
123,period
124,You know what I'm saying but
125,because you get sick
126,and because
127,your mind does things to you as a program to keep you
128,like you always playing chess
129,Mm
130,So
131,if you ain't the true you ain't really the one that's in control
132,that mind'll keep checking you checking you all the time like
133,Aw man
134,damn
135,You know what I am saying because it's not really in cl it's not really in sync
136,Yeah
137,<>
138,with shit It's part of the system too
139,Oh my gosh whispered
140,I don't know I know I'm just
141,going on and on but like
142,this all started from you just asking me about my name
143,You know what I'm saying?
144,Name and age bruh I'm amazed
145,You kn
146,word
147,Nah that's that's cool though That's cool I'm th I think we're definitely gonna we are already on five minutes we are through that
148,<> Ay um
149,Word
150,??
151,so how do you feel about turning forty?
152,I mean
153,I don't really look at time as age I feel like I was born in the same moment that I'm in right now
154,I mean unless we freeze time
155,Ooh
156,<>
157,unless we freeze time
158,inaudible
159,you cannot say the day changed
160,The day is continuous There is no breaks in day Our mind tricks us
161,to think that we going to sleep and we waking up No you sleep in two cycles
162,This is the part of the dream you can control
163,And the one where you
164,socalled fall asleep that's when you actually awake
165,You can't control your body cause your body is made f
166, as a suit to play around in this system
167,When the true you come out
168,it's like that first person on Call of Duty or something
169,You don't see your arms and your legs and all of that Like I think we was touching on this before you don't see all of that You only see
170,a point of awareness
171,And when you socalled wake up
172,you literally sleeve your body on and zip up a zipper and come out here and start playing
173,That shit cool as fuck
174,<>
175,Yeah man
176,For real
177,On some realness
178,You know what I'm saying? And they keep and the body is so sensitive to this system
179,Oh ?
180,That's why it's got nerves and pain and this and this
181,It's just like keeping a ship
182,with all the pressure right
183,Oh my god whispered
184,and
185,keeping the
186,compression chambers so ain't no air seeping and all of that
187,That's exactly what it is man
188,It's a spaceship
189,<>
190,Oh man whispered
191,it's a spaceship
192,And you gotta constantly g but it's it's
193,so d it's
194,it's not just a spaceship It's
195,everything concentrated into this
196,Mm
197,Like you got
198,stars
199,planets
200,empty space dark space all of this is
201,k smashed into your body and it's just exploded Like
202,this is just the bowels of another big body
203,and we the bacteria in that body
204,Kind of like how we talking about the cells It's somebody talking about us like that
205,Mm
206,Being the cells
207,A upside down pyramid magnifying glass just like we look at ants and shit
208,<>
209,In their world
210,it's a lot of them
211,Excuse my French it's a lot of them
212,But
213,in their world
214,this looks
215,like just this yard looks like a whole planet to them
216,You know what I'm saying but to us
217,we just looking at 'em like
218,Oh my gosh that probably look like the
219,coolest shit oh Being deprived of that
220,we
221,like we in
222,<>
223,for so many years and then being able to see that shit
224,And then it's just like us
225,We in a aquarium
226,Somebody's looking at us in a round fish tank
227,or I believe a square one
228,a flat square one with two holes in it
229,Like two records on top of each other
230,Hold on time out
231,That's that flat earth
232,So do you feel like the equivalant of us
233,like
234,jumping out of a fish tank we would just be flapping on the ground of the floor o of the fish tank or some shit
235,<>
236,No when you get out the fish tank you truly free
237,You trying to get out of the fish tank All of this is
238,I mean I'm I mean I'm I'm saying the
239,the goldfish or whatever is
240,is truly free when they're out of
241,The fish tank
242,the fish tank But
243,if they're in the real world and they're just a
244,or if they're in the you know world for that example
245,and they just flopping around
246,Mmhm
247,what they
248,what is the
249,just gonna die?
250,Or they just gonna nothing's gonna happen?
251,Well not in the literal sense w w when you looking at it like
252,like this If you was
253,in a fish tank inside of the ocean
254,and somebody dropped you to the ocean floor and you see all these other fi fish just passing you up
255,Mm
256,and you in this tank
257,You can't get
258,Mmhm
259,but so far and you notice and everybody's going a lot further than you are
260,Oh yeah
261,Once you get out you truly free
262,Oh okay
263,You see what I'm saying?
264,Hoo okay
265,But
266,the analogy wasn't a great analogy cause it's a somebody will say a cynic will say well
267,that don't make no sense if you in the ocean and of course you gonna want the freedom cause you see the other fish moving around
268,Ah okay
269,But
270,the jump
271,outside of the fish tank what I'm saying like we saying this system is broken Basically this system is okay
272,but the system's been hacked
273,by a virus
274,Mm
275,A virus is in here changing the software
276,doing stuff that it ain't supposed to be doing to us
277,So
278,when you have these heavy influences destructive influences on you
279,like with your mind
280,and your thoughts and your emotions
281,it's because something is playing that up that way
282,That ain't truly you The true you is a baby
283,that knows how to enjoy themselves in the moment
284,Don't need no friends don't need no toys
285,just could
286,m m
287,play and just be happy
288,Get along with everything love all animals You might have a little fear or something Some things might scare you because
289,you got this internal defense
290,when something's aggressive like a dog or something It might scare
291,you know but it's still
292,being taught by grownups to put that fear in you
293,Cause it's some kids that
294,So really you feel like
295,it's the inner thing
296,You're already complete
297,that
298,that change you
299,or makes you
300,Yeah
301,more or whatever than the outer
302,It's the
303,I guess things
304,I mean
305,But the outer circumstance do
306,play a big part in it
307,you know
308,of course
309,But truly you know if it was
310,you know just focused on that it would be no problem
311,The biggest punishment I've learned
312,is
313,losing control of your emotions
314,Okay
315,It's not just
316,losing control of your emotions You're putting destructive out in the world
317,It's like
318,a s whole slew of stuff happens
319,Oh yeah?
320,When you speak
321,in a bad way you cursing somebody Those are true curses
322,Mmhm
323,Like spells are made out of just words like you could put you see a
324,a magician put a spell on somebody and they'll just use words They don't need to use a wand
325,or no canteen no potion They could just say something to 'em somebody and they'd be in a trance
326,Yeah
327,So words are powerful
328,That's one thing
329,Then if you say
330,real hateful stuff it turn some of it it turn concern into these mortal
331,soulless thoughts
332,Okay
333,that are basically air parasites and they turn into insects and all this other stuff that we see So like
334,you see a insect you ain't never seen before and it's got this long stinger on and all this other
335,those are manifestations of our thoughts that are rogue
336,Some of them take shape and wanna whisper in your ear destructive stuff to you all the time
337,Damn
338,You know and then
339,like say
340,something is innocent you might think is being indecisive
341,Like saying baby where you wanna go eat? Let's go eat at Burger King Nah let's go eat at Red Lobster Nah let's go to Burger King Nah let's get
342,When you do that
343,you destroy
344,your the gallbladder
345,I remember you saying that and um
346,<clears throat>
347,try not to be indecisive
348,Indecisive Frustration attacks your pancreas
349,<>
350,Frustration attacks your pancreas
351,Mmhm
352,Anger attacks your liver
353,Mmhm
354,Worry attacks your stomach
355,Okay
356,Sadness attacks your lungs
357,Mmhm
358,Anxiety attacks your heart
359,Mm
360,Depression
361,attacks your spine
362,And everything from
363,um um um like um a lot of people everybody say there's no cure for fibromyalgia whatever whatever
364,Fibromyalgia is caused by depression
365,Mm
366,Depression puts such a overload on your circuits
367,in your body that they basically look like
368,a bunch of overloaded circuits
369,And then you start feeling pain everywhere
370,It gets rogue because you done depressed yourself so much
371,that your s your body can't take it
372,Like you press me down
373,And now I'm shortcircuiting
374,It's like putting a robot in inside of a vice and turning it
375,Mm
376,Oh yeah
377,You gonna start seeing sparks and them exploding and shit a after a while
378,because it's too much pressure
379,And then he's putting that on hisself
380,an internal vice
381,We I'm trying to give you a visualization of a vice squeezing somebody in a factory
382,Oh my gosh
383,But imagine a internal one that's around your brain
384,And your brain is attached to your spine ing
385,Ah hurry hurry you're the worst
386,And your brain tells your body what to do and your spine controls everything else Once that stuff starts to
387,dry up and get crippled and stiff and all that and you get pain and all
388,your whole body goes to crap
389,And ain't no doctor gonna tell you depression causes fibromyalgia but I'm telling you it does
390,Mm
391,And depression is caused by inflammation
392,Your body has got inflammation somewhere
393,and it's keeping the circulation from getting to your brain so your brain is making destructive chemicals instead of good ones
394,Know what that's kind of reminding me of?
395,I seen a movie
396,What?
397,um
398,the other day
399,Dang I can't even remember the name of it
400,but it was in theaters right n
401,right now
402,And they're they're on the plane I mean they're on the s sh ship
403,Mmhm
404,and it's
405,two of them woke up before the time
406,they was supposed to get to the
407,planet and it's like
408,six thousand years in the future
409,What? What is this called?
410,This is a movie about to come out?
411,On silver screen?
412,Yeah it's already out right now
413,It's already out?
414,Ah I want to say something like the blavity or something but it might not be that It might be something else
415,the ship
416,Okay
417,I'm'a I'm'a actually look it up right now but
418,um
419,it's pretty cool like I like the graphics or whatever But um
420,yeah they
421,they on a
422,they I guess they found another earth
423,with the same type of atmosphere
424,as ours
425,Right
426,right
427,so they was gonna go there you know colonize it do what they do whatever
428,But they had like I guess six thousand of some of the brightest people on earth
429,And they was gonna send them off
430,you know to do
431,you know whatever It's gonna take six thousand years for the next
432,set of people to come up there
433,You know that cryogenics they just perfected it
434,Mm
435,They said they can send human bodies into space as of today
436,And put them in a cryosleep state a like frozen
437,Oh my gosh for just somebody gonna pick that shit up ??
438,A a and it's
439,And they and they could go like a thousand years on a ship
440,and wake up and still
441,age just a little bit because they basically frozen
442,at the right temperature that the cells don't crystallize and kill themselves cause that's how you die
443,When you starting to freeze
444,your body's systems will slow way down and some people be frozen all the way
445,solid
446,Mmhm
447,and then thaw out and be f perfectly fine
448,So there's stories like that I've seen a lady trapped up under the ice that was
449,What do you think your cells is doing when
450,it's completely cold like that?
451,See one of two things can happen
452,It slows the heart rate down so slow
453,that you basically i suspended in time
454,Or
455,the ce s something happens where the cells crystallize
456,and once they start to turn into crystals they bust through the cell walls
457,And you basically bleed to death and ooze out all your cell matter into your body because there's crystallizing you
458,<>
459,in a artificial way
460,So your body's supposed to be crystal
461,Oh
462,Yeah
463,You know your phone and your TV all that's liquid
464,crystal
465,display
466,LCD
467,That's what your body is
468,Oh for real?
469,Liquid
470,crystal
471,What happens to water when you freeze it?
472,That's what that s stood for?
473,Wha um
474,I guess it look
475,you know crystal
476,I guess
477,Yeah what happens to rock candy r when you put sugar and water together and you hang a string from it?
478,It turn into crystals
479,Oh yeah oh yeah true true
480,It crystalizes
481,Mmhm
482,You know what I'm saying your body is the same thing It's made of water and all of that
483,Mmhm
484,And when you freeze it water turns into crystal
485,Oh man whispered
486,But there's a way of
487,tuning up water
488,where you raise the vibrational frequency of water and it turns into quartz
489,instead of rock candy
490,or it turns into rose
491,quartz or
492,calcite or
493,mold you know something
494,that you have to mine out of a cave
495,And be like yo water
496,helped 
497,make this limestone like
498,been dripping for a thousand years and now it made these huge stalactites that's in this cave
499,Water is some amazing shit but it could get polluted
500,Crystals
501,don't really they can't get polluted They absorb
502,energy off of shit
503,And yeah they can overload but all you gotta do is put 'em in the sun or under a full moon and they fully recharge
504,You can't do that with water
505,You could pour I could pour a sludge in that shit right now and fucking put that shit in the sun and the moon and it's still gonna be sludge in that shit in the morning
506,You know what I'm saying
507,It gotta be pure
508,It's gotta be pu it's hard to keep water pure
509,because we in such
510,a fucking riddled virus
511,environment
512,The virus wants to keep shit polluted
513,It wants you to think crazy It wants to put all this
514,on him
515,on s
516,on you so you could keep
517,feeding it because see
518,the thing that is
519,the reason why this virus is here because it needs to feed
520,and the only way you can feed on something
521,is by making it scared
522,Oh okay
523,It's like
524,you can't
525,you can't
526,like if some vampires came in here right now
527,if you just riddled with fear you gonna get bit
528,Okay
529,But if you standing there waiting with a stake and some holy water and a super soaker gun and some garlic and shit
530,Yeah
531,you're ready for whatever
532,What if you just standing there and you not with all that shit?
533,See
534,sometimes you could go to another place like
535,Mmhm
536,you know that's the one dimensional way of defending yourself But then
537,you might
538,turn something on inside of you that cause you
539,different
540,Yeah
541,And be able to fight the vampires head up
542,Oh shit
543,Yeah
544,You know but that it's it's all about keeping
545,this
546,defense up all the time like
547,it ain't true peace here because the system's been hacked
548,Whatever jumped in here
549,thirtyfive hundred BC
550,really messed everything up man
551,That's the real thing of everything
552,Oh the thing with the ship though
553,they built it to be an ish
554,indestructible ship
555,But um
556,I guess somewhere in they calculations
557,they didn't plan for a big ass meteorite to just come slap that shit
558,Oh wow
559,Wow
560,Slap the fuck out that bitch but
561,it destroyed
562,So that shit still rolling around pretty much impenetrable
563,Mm
564,or whatever
565,But
566,shit malfunctioning now
567,Mm
568,Six thousand people still asleep
569,You know
570,ain't nobody gonna survive being on that ship for six thousand years just to make it to that other planet
571,You can't turn back around
572,It's gonna take you like
573,three hundred
574,um years to get back home and shit like that or
575,you was probably like halfway out or some shit
576,Right
577,Over with for your ass
578,Mm
579,So they going around
580,throughout this ship
581,after they realize
582,cause they ain't realize til much later on that the ship was actually fucked up That's the reason they was out in the first place
583,Right
584,And then um
585,they actually had to fix the
586,ship or at least try to
587,Well see the sleep state is not
588,to keep
589,it's just to keep your body in a state of unconsciousness
590,Yeah
591,Well then you ain't on no planet there's no time
592,That's why there's no such thing as time If you was in the spaceship right now how would you keep track of the time?
593,If you away from our sun and you away from our earth how would you be able to keep track of time?
594,Oh yeah yeah It's impossible
595,It's impossible because there's no way
596,You gonna have no where to start either
597,this is a program for you to count how many times the sun and the moon go up to make you age
598,If you could tune that shit out
599,Woah
600,and know you timeless you could lis l your body will last
601,longer than proba just as long as the earth itself cause you made of the earth
602,and you made of space stuff
603,Like it don't make sense that we dying in a hundred years or
604,i li life expectally lesser than that
605,It's because of the emotions
606,The emotions
607,sink so deep into your organs
608,if you don't know how to get 'em out
609,they stay in there
610,And the only thing I've noticed that get 'em out is those frequencies
611,Like you can take anger out
612,immediately You can take
613,somebody having a gallbladder attack and let them listen to a indecisive binaural beat
614,and their gallbladder will miraculously loosen up
615,Like I've experienced all that hernias and
616,just listen to solar plexus healing and
617,you know opening your root up A lot of people's roots are closed
618,All of this is is
619,Okay
620,you know
621,the things that
622,people like exa for example the police brutality
623,Okay
624,or the police shootings
625,Mmhm
626,If a lot more fuc
627,a lot more people was putting
628,crystals and stuff in their car
629,You know they have might have a quartz crystal here
630,and some charcoal pile right on the floor
631,Mmhm
632,smudging their car with white sage and stuff like that
633,Yeah
634,You're gonna have a less lot m
635,runins
636,than just
637,jumping out here scared
638,every time you see a cop
639,That's true
640,I mean it's the f it's the f whole fear factor thing
641,that makes you feel like the prey all the time
642,If you stop feeling like prey
643,then you'll stop being hunted
644,Dang
645,Instantly
646,right there
647,I mean I know some a some hard dudes and
648,soon as the cops come around
649,<>
650,they be like don't look to the side
651,Don't look over your shoulder
652,Your seatbelt on and all this I'm just like
653,dog just
654,be e I mean you're not a criminal
655,You out here you just enjoying your vehicle
656,Yeah but sometimes you don't gotta be <>
657,You know what I'm saying and even like I told you my experience
658,Mmhm
659,Everything will be okay when it's supposed to be okay
660,Just when you know it's gonna be okay it's gonna be alright
661,That's how I be tryna go in this situation
662,Cause most of them motherfuckers I'm around don't excuse me most of the people I'm around don't live they life like that ing
663,Mmhm
664,Nah that's good you
665,be keeping good company
666,Yeah man I've always been around a lot of humble good people like yourself man
667,So where are you from?
668,I'm from RDADDRESS
669,Connecticut
670,RDPLACE Connecticut How long have you been living in Atlanta?
671,Since nineteen eightyeight
672,Oh nineteen eightyeight okay
673,October twentysecond nineteen eightyeight
674,So you really pretty much even though Atlanta
675,I guess been a
676,a s forefront type city but you s definitely seen Atlanta on the rise though
677,Yeah I remember
678,eighties and nineties
679,til
680,boy
681,two thousands
682,Yeah man
683,RDPLACE RDPLACEand RDPLACE I've seen change dramatically
684,Wow whispered
685,I mean
686,before uh
687,when Freaknik and AU and all of that was popping Different World and
688,all of those shows was on
689,uh television
690,like Atlanta was on the uprise then Like
691,I was really enjoying the city at around those times around
692,the first Freakniks and all of that
693,not like I was
694,you know I ain't know what Freaknik was I just happened to go downtown
695,<>
696,Actually I was going to buy some sneakers from Walter's and
697,Ooh
698,I got on the train
699,Legendary
700,And I was at Doraville Station and when we got to Chamblee
701,Mmhm
702,the train kept going
703,inaudible
704,It was a whole bunch of people on the docks and I'm like
705,what's going on? They didn't stop the train un all the way until we got to Lenox
706,Yeah
707,So I get off at Lenox and it's a bunch of people on the train waiting for the train to transfer
708,Okay
709,I go to get to Five Points
710,and when I walked outside
711,it was just
712,oceans of people Like I've never seen that many people in my life And I was like
713,<>
714,what is going
715,on?
716,Yeah
717,And they was like Freaknik
718,Like what
719,inaudible
720,the heck is a Freaknik?
721,Freaknik whispered
722,Man
723,and I mean
724,that was a it was aggravating to me cause you know the the traffic was just stupid
725,The traffic was stupid
726,And the way they treated those students was just ridiculous Like
727,there was venues and things for them to do and the cops just like it's a police state like
728,blocking off exits and forcing people to stay on the highway that
729,that's ridiculousness Let people go where they want to go
730,unintelligible
731,You know what I'm saying If you
732,it's making the city money
733,and
734,they enjoying your city
735,and that's w a a what cities want they want that tourist money
736,Like when them s kids used to come
737,a hundred thousand strong hundred and fifty thousand strong
738,Man I m

1002,<>
1003,Yeah and that's so not good for you man That shit is got like s these heavy WiFi signals coming out that shit cau you should see
1004,what WiFi does to the body It causes cancer so quick
1005,And all these mutations in your cells and
1006,??
1007,Oh my <sound effect>
1008,and then just being in front of AC stuff It's that's called electromagnetic toxicity because your body
1009,is DC You direct current Your head
1010,is negative
1011,Well actually half of your body's negative other half is positive
1012,Yeah
1013,But
1014,you could also
1015,perceive it as the hands
1016,and the feet being negative Those are your outlets And the head being positive
1017,So when you
1018,that's like a battery you put in your remote
1019,AC is all your electronic devices which is
1020,plus minus plus minus plus minus plus minus real fast
1021,Mmhm
1022,It's a alternating current You a direct current
1023,Yeah
1024,When that alternating current hits this direct current body
1025,Mm yeah
1026,you got one that's flowing straight
1027,Okay
1028,and another one that's jagged
1029,Okay
1030,When you intersect the two the one that's straight
1031,it's impossible for it to stay straight because it's got all this
1032,so what
1033,your heart let's say is
1034,V one o three when that h shit hits it
1035,<exhale> it's one o three point one
1036,You can't barely hear the radio station just by them two little
1037,that one little turn
1038,Oh
1039,your heart is not beating right no more
1040,Oh man whispered
1041,Your brain frequency supposed to be at
1042,ninetyseven point five
1043,And then that damn AC hit that shit and that shit turns it down to
1044,ninetyseven point three You can't hear nothing but static
1045,And then the more shit you turn on it kno keeps knocking the points down
1046,You know what I'm saying like
1047,that shit is no joke man
1048,And that shit is hard to detox that cause your body don't understand artificial toxins
1049,Like it's hard to get rid of chemical toxins
1050,Uh the best way to get rid of 'em
1051,is to run them out
1052,That's why people sit in saunas
1053,and go
1054,exercise and get a good sweat
1055,That's the best way to get out chemical poison
1056,Oh man whispered
1057,But electrom
1058,electromagnetic poisoning and emotional poisoning
1059,and that shit is some hard shit to get rid of boy
1060,Hold on so if
1061,let's say
1062,hypothetically
1063,or whatever
1064,if I start working out
1065,Mmhm
1066,like really physically going for it in a good healthy type of way
1067,That's a investment
1068,will
1069,will that have my
1070,my inner cells
1071,in my body living a better life amongst themselves or something?
1072,Of course
1073,because
1074,Oh man whispered
1075,when you
1076,exercise you release
1077,chemicals
1078,Okay
1079,Your brain starts to spit
1080,out chemicals It's just like when you don't exercise
1081,Your body's
1082,your mind is basically saying
1083,or your brain is basically saying
1084,this body don't really wanna shit
1085,so let me start killing it off some
1086,Cause you feel like you just
1087,ain't no motion to it

1095,inaudible
1096,But if you in motion
1097,Mm

161,definitely comes from my mom
162,Okay
163,Um
164,you know the way I treat a woman things of that nature
165,you know I g
166,I
167,those are the little nuggets I got from my mom
168,Mm
169,coming up
170,Mm
171,So we're pretty close to answer your question
172,Um now we're not as close
173,you know just because you know
174,of age maybe
175,you know but
176,you know
177,So
178,what about um
179,your grandparents? You got a relationship

182,Uh my dad's mom I definitely had a relationship prior to her passing as well
183,Mmhm
184,I actually saw my grandmother and my aunt and uncles more than I actually saw my dad which was kind of weird
185,But
186,Okay
187,the family didn't love me any less
188,because my dad wasn't around They actually kind of embraced me more

200,you never did? Or
201,did you get away with things that they didn't get away with

207,um I can't really answer that question
208,Okay
209,you know effectively
210,Mmhm

213,when one got in trouble we all got in trouble you know
214,Nah I definitely understand that
215,What about um
216,aunts and uncles
217,cousins?
218,Um
219,I mean we were all pretty close coming up
220,um

222,dad's side of the family than I was my mom's side
223,Mmhm
224,you know but
225,but you know
226,um
227,you know

357,maybe saw something in me at a very
358,young age Because I would

360,I promise you I will come to cl
361,come to school go to home room
362,Mmhm
363,Right after home room I was in his class all day
364,I would literally skip class
365,Mmhm
366,Um I would
367,do everything
368,possible to just stay in his class all day til
369,til it became a point where I was getting put out of my
370,scheduled classes
371,and they would send me
372,to Mr  because they knew that was the only place I would work
373,Mmhm
374,you know or do do what I had to do because I was so geek to play music at the time
375,Wow
376,So he had a little beat up drum set in the um band room
377,in uh in the band closet
378,I used to go in there
379,uh put pieces together It
380,it maybe like a
381,actual bass drum that you play in the marching band and he'd have a drum pedal
382,It might be a piece of a high hat stand
383,Um
384,if not
385,I was using two cymbals
386,and I would just put 'em on like
387,you know cymbal stands little flimsy cheap ass cymbal stands This little
388,drum throne would be broke as fuck
389,The snare would be broke as fuck
390,And I would just sit there and make
391,make rhythms
392,Um
393,Woah
394,you know what I'm saying to the point where he put me in the talent show
395,And I I vaguely remember it
396,but
397,you know the few middle school friends I have talked to about it they've
398,they've reminded me They never forget the story so it must have been like a epic moment for me
399,Hey fu ing
400,you know what I'm saying at the time
401,Ha yeah
402,And from there I just kind of kept that MO
403,Mm

410,the marching band would be in there practicing
411,choral and orchestra music
412,and I'm sitting in there I'm the only nigga playing the piano
413,At this time I discovered I wanted to play piano
414,you know what I'm saying And then
415,just started vibing out man and just
416,I would sit there and just play I knew I wasn't gonna play their actual concert
417,but I would just sit there and learn music and
418,come up with different melodies and things Man it just kind of stuck with me um
419,out of high school and I
420,realized I could make honest money doing it man I been doing it ever since

457,from the darker side of things you know But
458,my mo again my mother did
459,what she had to do
460,and I don't
461,regret anything I went through

664,You can somebody can legitimately c make a case that
665,JayZ top five top three
666,Absolutely
667,Okay
668,Um and I say this for various reasons One
669,his lyrical content
670,When you break it down he's speaking real shit
671,like real shit
672,You know what I'm saying he's not a gimmick rapper He's very organic with his shit
673,Okay that's true
674,Secondly
675,Flow
676,you know what I'm saying from his business aspect and how he moves as a businessman is fucking impeccable
677,I respect that
678,Thirdly his fucking music catalog
679,You know what I'm saying his catalog is crazy um
680,like
681,beyond crazy
682,You know what I'm saying that

685,not too many niggas really fucking with him
686,Mmmm
687,at all
688,Okay
689,You know what I'm saying so
690,What about the Kendrick album?

698,You know what I'm saying I I heard his music for the first time
699,Yeah
700,Um
701,first record I heard was Section Eighty Rigamortus
702,Okay
703,um
704,and never looked back
705,Kendrick to me is one of the most prolific poets
706,He's under
707,he's underrated
708,as a as a artist man Like he I feel like his shine is
709,hi he got
710,too mu he has a lot to do
711,He's gonna be around for he's definitely one of the ones man Kendrick is
712,he's just phenomenal man like
713,Is he better than Drake though?
714,Yes
715,Okay you wanna s
716,Lyrically?
717,just period
718,Better rapper
719,Mm
720,Nah
721,Damn
722,Nah huh
723,That's a great discussion
724,That's like a Biggie and Tupac
725,So i it really depends on what you like
726,Okay
727,musically
728,You know what I'm saying cause Drake can get gritty
729,Drake early shit
730,killing
731,You Can Thank Me Now
732,killing
733,He's it's killing and I know a lot of people when they think of Kendrick they always wanna go back to Section Eighty
734,Yeah
735,It's his hardest album
736,because that wa no yeah It was his hardest
737,that one and the r
738,??
739,and the record he did with uh Schoolboy Q
740,Mmhm

748,You like Damn too don't you?
749,Yeah my f my favorite record

751,Kendrick's records
752,top two would be Rigamortus

754,and
755,Black Boy Fly
756,I love that song I'm at first I kind of slept on it
757,but now I really listen to
758,And I probably would put Black Boy Fly over Rigamortus
759,because I'm a actual musician
760,you know what I'm saying
761,Wow okay
762,Yeah
763,I like the message behind Black boy Fly
764,Hell yeah

772,Mm
773,Mm
774,<ts>
775,Depends on it's gonna sound really weird and uh it's not a cocky statement but it depends on the time of
776,the time of day
777,you know what's going on Um sometimes I
778,can go for the businesswoman the
779,you know the very
780,laid back
781,but fine as hell
782,but she covering it all up
783,you know what I'm saying but you know what it is

1245,So what about Common though?
1246,Co
1247,We was just mentioning Common in the acting shit
1248,We was
1249,I think for me Common man it's
1250,it's his message
1251,It's conscious
1252,relevant
1253,message music
1254,You know what I'm saying like I think he just did a record if I'm not mistaken for
1255,that uh that slave movie that was out
1256,um
1257,<ts>
1258,uh Birth of a Nation
1259,He did a record
1260,and I think I got the record on my phone but
1261,Mmhm
1262,it was just crazy man how
1263,him speaking
1264,the truth and speaking he's speaking shit that's really relevantly going on in the world today
1265,You know what I'm saying he was hip
1266,you know because he s
1267,sought
1268,further knowledge
1269,You know and from that perspective I respect him because it
1270,reflects in his lyrical content You can that niggas level b
1271,of education through his lyrical delivery
1272,A lot of these niggas play themselves down for the industry
1273,You know what I'm saying but a lot of these niggas is really intelligent And I use the nig
1274,the nigga term
1275,as
1276,embracing my fellow
1277,you know
1278,brethren for the record because I know that's a conversation in itself
1279,you know what I'm saying the meaning behind it But I have to state that because this is going on a public record
1280,Yeah yeah yeah definitely
1281,and I don't want my image to be tainted or reflected you know what I'm saying in such a way So I mean it as a
1282,as a gesture of endearment you know what I'm saying like
1283,Yeah this is unedited
1284,Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah hell yeah
1285,no edits
1286,all the way through
1287,If you play a l
1288,piece of it play all of it
1289,Don't play it out of context
1290,Exactly
1291,you know what I'm saying so that's why I that comes from just
1292,watching other niggas put their foot in they mouth saying shit socially
1293,via Breakfast Club or you know Sway in the Morning
1294,Mm
1295,uh Everyday Struggle
1296,Yeah the
1297,syndicated record shows of that
1298,of that nature you know what I'm saying
1299,My thought personally in that
1300,I'll be straight if you had your own platform big enough that like ay okay
1301,I see what y'all saying
1302,Make sure y'all
1303,hear me when I say this This is how I feel about the situation Some people got that
1304,Exactly
1305,Exactly
1306,Yeah like I respect the guy Vince Mensa for going up there and telling Akademiks That he smack the shit out of 'em because that's some real nigga shit But at the end of the day
1307,Yeah
1308,he told 'em in such a intellectual way and he had a dialogue
1309,that was crazy to back up
1310,He did
1311,his reasoning for why
1312,Yeah
1313,He did
1314,he made that statement
1315,you know what I'm saying he had no choice but to respect him
1316,But that was still on camera and that's a on camera threat like
1317,if anybody is smart they'll say
1318,Yeah it definitely is
1319,nah we ain't doing it
1320,Lawsuit
1321,Yeah
1322,I mean yeah lawsuit all that different type of stuff I met you at my job I can get fired I can lose money
1323,But I don't think Akademiks would take it that far because it's
1324,it's the culture
1325,you know what I'm saying You can't deny the culture
1326,Now if I was
1327,in Akademik's situation
1328,personally
1329,You mighta reacted different
1330,I woulda reacted in a way like
1331,he did on camera
1332,but then
1333,y'all prob
1334,Behind
1335,y'all woulda heard in the blog somewhere like oh shit after the set god damn that nigga Slay ing and Vic Mensa really went at it He really had to stomp that nigga
1336,<>
1337,<>
1338,Yeah
1339,Yeah ing
1340,cause Slay fucked around
1341,Yeah ing
1342,<>
1343,It woulda <>
1344,definitely woulda been one of them situations
1345,But
1346,I don't know man
1347,It's a different world out here
1348,It's just a different time and
1349,Yeah
1350,you gotta
1351,navigate accordingly
1352,The thing is they want us to be monkeys and they want us
1353,They want that shit
1354,like movies like I don't know if you've ever seen the movie Bamboozled
1355,Mmmm But that sound like something unintelligible
1356,but it the you kn if not you need to watch it bro It depicts
1357,the way the Black man in my opinion
1358,to a certain extent
1359,Yeah
1360,is viewed
1361,via entertainment let it be music
1362,Mmhm

1397,you know what I'm saying that comes from adversity?
1398,You know
1399,you know so you know

1402, you know what I'm saying
1403,you know it's the movement
1404,the movement like
1405,<>
1406,the movement is real

1414,cool brother man

1419,dropping that um
1420,volume in the back with the music a little bit just off for a little bit
1421,Yeah
1422,That joint is riding so much right now
1423,?

1425,Tyler you let me know in the next interview but
1426,this is sounding really good though
1427,Yeah hell yeah We in a we in a good place with it
1428,<>
1429,Good place I think this ended out
1430,on a pretty high note man If there's anything else
1431,you wanna just say just to say
1432,you more than welcome We pretty much done hit
1433,our threshold mark
1434,Oh facts
1435,Mmhm
1436,Well I'll I'll say this first and foremost man
1437,you know what I'm saying this is
1438,is r the realest shit I could ever probably say out my mouth
1439,on the record
1440,Okay
1441,at my age
1442,at the age of thirty you know what I'm saying for the record
1443,Yeah
1444,Mmhm
1445,For all who don't know April six Aries nation you know what I'm saying
1446,fuck yeah
1447,You know what I'm saying but
1448,real nigga shit
1449,always take care of the ones around you
1450,Make sure they eat
1451,just as m
1452,just as much as you if not more
1453,With that you'll you'll grow in your success a lot further and a lot faster versus
1454,tryna do everything for self
1455,or you eating and you giving 'em nuggets because
1456,at that point when everybody's eating around you everybody's happy everybody's working everybody's moving
1457,But the moment somebody feels inadequate
1458,that's when all hell breaks loose
1459,So I say this to any mogul
1460,or anybody coming up
1461,that's building a team and tryna build their brand and branding themselves and they career man
1462,Build a team of people that you know you don't mind investing in
1463,And make sure they all do something different
1464,like m you know like my man said and uh you know a earlier quote that I heard a few minutes ago
1465,make sure everybody does something different because it brings a different entity It brings a different
1466,way of thinking
1467,and respect your peers
1468,You know respect them for they craft
1469,Um
1470,put them at a
1471,in a place where
1472,they're always challenged because
1473,always leave room to grow
1474,Because when you become comfortable you c become stagnant and you become reprobate in your mindset
1475,So you know what I'm saying you definitely don't wanna
1476,wanna do that man and just
1477,you know I just encourage you know what I'm saying just everybody man to keep going
1478,keep grinding you know
1479,Your time is now

67,You was there when that bih hit?

69,S so was it the whole state or was it just some of it?
70,It was it was basically like New Orleans the whole New Orleans uptown downtown
71,Real New Orleans
72,Mm
73,the east you know what I mean Like everything really got
74,Mm
75,real fucked up down there you feel me You know a lot of a lot of a lot of people lost they lives A lot of floods took
76,took
77,everything out
78,you feel me
79,And also one thing I'd like to say is like
80,Mmhm
81,um
82,in the Ninth Ward you feel me
83,like
84,they blew the levee bro
85,I don't like
86,people people are gonna say what they wanna say but at the end of the day that levee
87,that levee been blown before
88,and the damage that was done to the levee
89,a
90,a flood or hurricane literally couldn't do that type of damage you feel what I'm saying
91,Mm
92,S yeah so
93,you know
94,That's discouraging unintelligible to hear
95,Yeah
96,Yeah man
97,But you know I'm always pro
98,um
99,what's the word?
100,Conspiracy theory and shit
101,Yeah
102,And I feel like that was definitely
103,something folks was mentioning but you know kind of got swept to the side a little bit
104,Yeah you feel me
105,Hm
106,Do you feel like
107,it's any possible way that um somebody breaking the levees would
108,possibly help that situation
109,at that time?
110,Not necessarily I feel like they b they broke the levee for at the end of the day everything else in New Orleans especially the up and the down
111,downtown New Orleans as far as the Ninth Ward like to get flooded you feel me for
112,you know not ins
113,not insurances
114,Mm
115,policies but at the end of the day for like
116,to
117,to bring hurt towards the people You know New Orleans is a very
118,I'm'a use this word sin city city you feel me
119,Mm
120,And it's a lot of it's a lot of stuff that people you know don't understand that go on
121,A lot of people say voodoo
122,Mmhm
123,you know Geechee stuff go down there but at the end of the day
124,it's
125,it's really that
126,You know it's a lot of sin you know So
127,Mm
128,in my eyes I really look at it like you know
129,in the Bible God said you know like
130,he w he will cleanse the i
131,cleanse the earth
132,and I feel like New Orleans that
133,Hurricane Katrina
134,and Hurricane Rita had cleansed New Orleans
135,to a certain extent
136,Mm
137,you know
138,Mm
139,Mm
140,That's very very interesting
141,I don't know how deep of your New O
142,New Orleans knowledge you got
143,Yeah
144,but you know I'm'a at least
145,ask see if I can learn something out of this joint
146,M yeah you got to You got to
147,Um
148,let's
149,we gonna double back to
150,NO right quick Let's get to the GA part
151,Alright
152,So um
153,you was done with um s
154,school like grade school
155,when you um
156,before you got to Atlanta right?
157,Yeah yeah yeah yeah
158,Mm
159,So how was that transition from moving to NO to Georgia? You don't got no friends from
160,high school or
161,you know
162,shit like that How did you um
163,adjust? Did you have family down here?
164,Uh we my cousin  stayed down here you know
165,and um
166,cousin  used to stay with us in the past you feel me He he went through a little a little a little drug problem but
167,you know God touched his heart a and saved him you feel me and made him bounce back how he's supposed to
168,So we end up staying with him and his wife and his two daughters you feel me so
169,you know that that put a big insight as far as Atlanta
170,You know so we had we had a little family down here but
171,Mm
172,everything was totally different you know
173,trees the hills
174,not the city you know like
175,you know just
176,moving around people was different the accents you know
177,But you know y you be one place long enough you l you learn a vibe You learn how to
178,how to educate yourself with certain
179,certain things you know
180,Mm
181,Okay
182,So the vibe
183,shoo okay
184,So how much has the vibe
185,changed from I guess ten years ago in Atlanta to now in regards to
186,just lingo?
187,Alright I'm'a I'm'a say this like
188,Atlanta lingo
189,alright like
190,you know they had the Goodie Mobs the OutKast you feel me you know
191,Mmhm
192,Atlanta always embraced like
193,other states with music
194,you know tryna find theyself you feel me but
195,<ts>
196,i it it was really the Goodie Mobs and the OutKast that really brought Atlanta really
197,to the
198,to the market of
199,mainstream as far as like music you get what I'm saying And
200,niggas was able to understand where niggas was coming from you feel me
201,Mmhm
202,And but now these days it's like
203,like I said other states influence Atlanta Atlanta is is a place where
204,it's not just people from Atlanta It's people from different countries people from different states so
205,Mmhm
206,it's
207,it's one big swag pool One big sauce pool you feel me so like
208,<>
209,you know like
210,That's cool
211,when I came down here it was GDs and Crips
212,Mmhm
213,you know
214,Now it's majority Bloods and Crips you know so at the end of the day it's like
215,you know s something influenced something you get what I'm saying
216,Mmhm
217,in order for things to be a little different
218,Mm
219,I think that's a real
220,real great point
221,So
222,so sauce
223,swag
224,what would be another word for that?
225,Flavor
226,Flavor <> Gotta have that flavor gotta have that drip
227,<> Flavor
228,You gotta have that fla you just gotta have that drip gotta you know what I mean It's like
229,<>
230,it's so many things you could say
231,Mmhm
232,But now
233,Atlanta is
234,the state that
235,influence other states
236,Mmhm
237,Everybody
238,wanna either have a little Atlanta when they rap
239,Just a little
240,when they dress
241,Mmhm
242,you know just like
243,what that boy name is?
244,In in New York I milly rock rapping
245,Mm
246,you know what I mean like he from the A but he moved to New York
247,Yeah
248,That Gucci gang Gucci gang he not from Atlanta you see what I'm saying like
249,??
250,Sound like it though
251,you feel me It's it's a lot of people that done got influenced from Atlanta cause Atlanta was like
252,the state that they looked at like
253,?
254,that the down East Coast you feel me like oh them niggas ain't them niggas slow
255,They don't talk fast you feel me
256,<>
257,but now at the end of the day everybody on they dick
258,Yeah
259,you feel me so
260,Mm
261,you know so
262,ay

267,you been here for a s quite some time it seem
268,Quite some time
269,seen a lot of shit
270,You seen some ups and some downs and certain people and situations
271,Mmhm
272,Do you have any um
273,proclamations on the future possibly?
274,Any trends you see?
275,I feel like if Atlanta keep on going the way they going they could probably run about a good nother ten years
276,Mm
277,before something else really just
278,Okay like it just gotta swing back over
279,Yeah you know a
280,Atlanta be winning so hard right now
281,Al hard right now It's like
282,but you know
283,hard as shit
284,but you know everything is a full circle
285,You know it start somewhere
286,Mmhm
287,and everybody have they time then it come back to where it originated from
288,you know So
289,it a it all depends on how you look at it You know like
290,nigga you know like I remember
291,Busta Rhymes had some shit where he diss he dissed Atlanta on that
292,that New York whatever song that was you feel me you know what I mean

294,Yeah
295,You know like
296,California wasn't messing with Atlanta

300,different things you feel me
301,and a lot of niggas came from a lot of states you feel me that had they own little swag you feel me
302,But at the end of the day when you which if you really listen to some shit on the radio
303,if you ain't really hearing niggas that sound like they from Atlanta you hearing Atlanta niggas and if not that you hearing
304,R and B shit
305,<>
